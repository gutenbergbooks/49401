<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>It affords us much pleasure to be able to present to the public the
Thirteenth Book of the FAITH-PROMOTING SERIES. The favor shown these
little
publications by both old and young among the Latter-day Saints encourages

us in the belief that they are read with interest, and, we trust, with
profit. The principal object in issuing them has been and is to increase

faith in the hearts of those who peruse them, by showing how miraculously

God has overruled everything for the benefit of those who try to serve
Him.
</p>

<p>If, by our efforts, faith can be implanted or increased in the hearts of
any we will certainly feel that our labors have not been in vain.</p>

<p>We trust this little work will find its way into many homes and afford
pleasure and instruction to all who read it.</p>

<p class="chapterHeading">BIRTH-PLACE&mdash;PARENTAGE&mdash;WILLIAM H. SCOTT
&mdash;AN INTERVIEW WITH A BAPTIST MINISTER&mdash;A TESTIMONY TO THE
TRUTH
OF "MORMONISM."</p>

<p>The writer, the second son of Thomas and Ann Aveson, was born in the
town of Bradford, Yorkshire, England, on August 22nd, 1847.</p>

<p>My father was an honest, hard-working man; he was not a believer in any
particular religion. My mother was more religiously inclined; her maiden

name was Fawcett. Both my father and mother were strict in training their

family, which consisted of nine children (seven sons and two daughters),

five of whom are now dead.</p>

<p>In the early part of 1860 we removed from Bradford to Malton, in
Yorkshire, staying there only about six weeks, and then went to reside at

Middlesbrough, Yorkshire, a very pretty town at that time. We arrived
there
February 29th, 1860.</p>

<p>On the 11th of February, 1862, I was engaged to work at Mr Joseph
Gould's printing office in Middlesbrough. My wages were three shillings
per
week. Mr. Gould was a printer himself and did most of the work. He had
only
one other employee working for him, and that was a boy named Richard
Sedgwick, through whom I procured my situation, and whose acquaintance I

had made a few months previously.</p>

<p>On the 5th of the following May I was bound apprentice to Mr. Gould.
After I signed the indenture, Mr. Brown, one of the witnesses to it, said

to me:</p>

<p>"There, my boy, you have tied a knot with your hand which you can't
unloose with your tongue."</p>

<p>The indenture stated that my wages should be three shillings and
sixpence per week the first year, with a yearly raise of one shilling per

week until I had served my time, which was seven years.</p>

<p>About a week after this, a young man, named William Henry Scott, was
engaged to work for Mr. Gould, and shortly afterwards was bound
apprentice
to him for three years. Mr. Scott was from Seaham Harbor, county of
Durham,
where his parents and their family resided.</p>

<p>The following August, Richard Sedgwick left Mr. Gould's employ and went
to work for a Mr. Thomas Carter, picture-frame maker, and was afterwards

bound apprentice to him.</p>

<p>William H. Scott was a fine, courteous young man, to whom I became very
much attached. He had resided in Middlesbrough only a short time when his

brother John wrote to him from Seaham Harbor, stating that his mother and

himself had become members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints, and earnestly desired William to investigate the principles and
doctrines of that Church. He told his brother to go to a man named
Anderson, who was a Latter-day Saint and a resident of Middlesbrough.</p>



<p>Notwithstanding William had recently become identified with the
Methodists, he went, according to request, and had an interview with
Brother Anderson regarding this new religion; and becoming convinced of
the
truth of "Mormonism," was baptized a member of the Church.</p>

<p>Brother W. H. Scott became a useful member of what was then known as the
Middlesbrough and Stockton branch. We often conversed together on the
first
principles of the latter-day gospel.</p>

<p>At this time (the Summer of 1862) I was feeling more religiously
inclined than I had ever before. One reason for this, probably, was
because
a religious revival was in progress. The Wesleyans, Primitive Methodists

and other religious sects were very energetic and obtained many
converts.
</p>

<p>About a year and a half previously my mother had become a member of the
Wesleyan Reformers, and I had told her that I did not think it would be
long before I should join one of the religious sects.</p>

<p>I was a regular attendant at a Baptist chapel and Sunday school, and
firmly believed that the principles and doctrines promulgated by the
Baptists were nearer like those the Savior taught than were set forth by

any other religious denomination I was acquainted with, and my mind was
fully made up to identify myself with that body.</p>

<p>One Summer evening in 1862, I attended a Baptist prayer meeting with the
firm intention of becoming converted to their faith and afterwards
applying
for baptism. I was under the impression that they made converts in the
same
way the Methodists did, but found I was mistaken.</p>

<p>At the close of the meeting I spoke to one of the members, and asked him
why they did not make converts at their prayer meetings. He said that was

not their mode of receiving members; he told me that when he joined the
Baptists he prayed to his Heavenly Father for the forgiveness of his
sins,
and after doing so he felt an inward feeling of happiness, which proved
to
him that his sins were forgiven; he said after informing his minister to

that effect he was baptized. The young man asked me to see the minister.
I
did as he wished me, and the minister appointed the following Saturday
evening for an interview with him.</p>

<p>According to promise, I went to his house at the appointed time and was
invited into the parlor. The minister's name was William Bontems. He
appeared to me to be a very good man. We were alone in the parlor and
conversed together for quite a while. He told me I must pray to the Lord

and get forgiveness of my sins, and then I could receive baptism. Another

appointment was made for me to see him in one week from that day.</p>

<p>I went home, thinking seriously over the matter. That night I retired to
rest a little earlier than usual. As soon as I entered my bed-room I
prayed
most fervently and humbly to my Heavenly Father, asking Him to forgive my

sins and to produce that happy feeling within my bosom which others
realized before receiving baptism. I spent about fifteen minutes, at
least,
in prayer but experienced no happy feeling whatever.</p>

<p>Next evening I again engaged in secret prayer, but realized no benefit.
I tried this for a week, with no marked effect. At the end of the week I

again went to the minister: told him I had prayed every night, but found
no
relief; and asked him if he could not pray for me. He replied:</p>

<p>"If all the ministers in the world were to pray for you they could not
save you."</p>

<p>After further conversation he requested me to continue my prayers,
believing the Lord would answer. I did as he told me several nights more,

but without success.</p>

<p>As soon as William H. Scott was identified with the Latter-day Saints he
became a zealous and energetic member, and was desirous that all those
whom
he was acquainted with should embrace the gospel. Working together in the

same establishment&mdash;in the same room&mdash;we had a good opportunity

to converse upon any topic that presented itself. I told William
concerning
my interviews with the Baptist minister, and that I had been praying
nightly to the Lord to obtain forgiveness of my sins, but, seemingly,
without effect.</p>

<p>William listened attentively and eagerly to my story. He had wished,
hoped and even prayed that I should be convinced of the latter day
gospel.
But I told him I could not see clearly into the principles taught by the

Latter-day Saints.</p>

<p>One evening shortly after this (the early part of August, I think)
feeling as if my continued prayers for a newness of heart were in vain, I

made up my mind to try once more, and if I experienced no difference,
would
give up the idea of becoming identified with the Baptists and would try
the
"Mormons."</p>

<p>That same morning while at work, William conversed with me again on the
principles advocated by the Latter-day Saints, and smilingly said:</p>

<p>"You'll have to join the `Mormons.'"</p>

<p>While conversing with him I experienced a heavenly feeling; a mist came
over me, I felt within me an influence I had never before realized. The
principles and doctrines of the latter-day gospel came clearly before me.

The Spirit of the Lord was with me, and I received a testimony of the
truth
of "Mormonism"&mdash;a testimony which I shall never forget. I was
supremely happy, rejoicing with "joy unspeakable." I told William I was
ready for baptism and asked him to introduce me to the Saints the next
Sunday.</p>



<h2><a name="1chap2">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="chapterHeading">THE FIRST LATTER-DAY SAINT MEETING&mdash;WILLIAM
H. SCOTT HAS AN INTERVIEW WITH MY MOTHER&mdash;SHE FORBIDS ME HAVING
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE "MORMONS."</p>

<p>It was on the Sunday following when I attended the first Latter-day
Saint meeting, having received permission to do so from my parents. That

morning I went as usual to the Baptist Sunday school, but did not enjoy
myself as much as heretofore. This I attributed to my lack of faith in
their doctrines. Knowing "Mormonism" to be true, I could gain no
satisfaction from any other source.</p>

<p>The place where the Latter-day Saint meeting was to be held was at a
small village called Eston, about four miles from Middlesbrough. Our
company left town for that place about 1 o'clock p.m., and consisted of
William Littlefair, president of the Middlesbrough and Stockton branch,
Thomas Watson, secretary of the branch, William H. Scott and myself. It
was
one of the happiest afternoons I ever spent. We were soon out of town,
tripping along through lovely green fields bedecked with flowers of
various
kinds. Being very much interested in the conversation of President
Littlefair and the other brethren&mdash;of course it was mostly
pertaining
to the gospel&mdash;the time passed away quickly and we soon arrived at
Eston, where the meeting was to be held at the house of a sister named
Fewster.</p>

<p>The meeting was opened with an appropriate hymn, then prayer by one of
the brethren. The sacrament was administered, and the hymn commencing,</p>



<blockquote><p>
"O, God, the Eternal Father,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who dwells amid the sky,"
</p></blockquote>
<p>was sung.</p>

<p>The time was mostly occupied by President Littlefair. As this was the
first meeting attended by me and the first time I had heard the gospel
preached I listened attentively to the words of the speakers.</p>

<p>After meeting we partook of tea with Sister Fewster, during which we
enjoyed a pleasant, sociable chat. Then we returned homeward, arriving in

Middlesbrough about 6 o'clock in the evening.</p>

<p>While penning this brief narrative I cannot help reflecting upon the
present time. Passing along to my Sunday meetings I often see a number of

boys, about my age at that time, and some older ones, loitering about the

streets, breaking the Sabbath, neglecting to attend worship, and many who

never even visit Sunday school. They have not the love for their
religion,
which filled my heart at their age. These remarks apply not only to the
young, but also to others more advanced in years, who often neglect their

meetings, excusing themselves on one frivolous pretext or another.</p>

<p>William H. Scott told President Littlefair that I desired baptism. The
president said as I was under age that rite could not be administered to

me. It was necessary for me to first obtain permission from my parents.
Thinking the best way to get their consent would be for William to talk
to
my mother on the subject of "Mormonism," I arranged an interview with
her.
Accordingly, William went and conversed with her on the first principles
of
the gospel. It was on a Thursday night. She was interested and listened
attentively to the teachings of the young preacher, for he was but a
young
man, seventeen years of age. At the close of the interview it was agreed

upon that in a week's time he should pay her another visit. The
appointment
was promptly kept, and at its close William gained my mother's consent to

my baptism. The next night, Friday, my father, on being consulted, said
he
was willing for me to do as I pleased.</p>

<p>As everything seemed to be working in my favor, I sought my mother's
consent, before retiring to rest on Saturday night, to attend another
meeting of the Saints, which was to be held in the afternoon of the next

day. Judge of my surprise on being told by her that she did not wish me
to
have anything more to do with so deluded a people, giving them a bad name

and saying:</p>

<p>"I would rather bury you in the churchyard than have you join the
Mormons."</p>

<p>Too full of grief to make any reply to her remarks, with drooping head
and aching heart I slowly went up stairs to my bed chamber and there
knelt
and prayed humbly and fervently to my Heavenly Father, while the tears
rolled down my cheeks.</p>

<p>Restlessly I lay upon my bed. "I would rather bury you in the churchyard
than have you join the Mormons." Oh, how these words rang in my ears! I
had
never been so tried before in my life. The knowledge that "Mormonism" was

true was firm in my heart, for I had received a testimony and was very
anxious to get baptized; but my hopes now were blighted. What course
should
I pursue? I was young&mdash;just approaching my fifteenth birthday&mdash;

and still under the control of my parents, whom I desired to obey in all

things. But could I give up "Mormonism" and deny the testimony I had
received? No, the Lord helping me, I would never do that.</p>

<p>Then, again, my temporal position weighed upon my heart. I had recently
been apprenticed in the printing business for seven years; and the laws
of
the country compelled me to serve out this time.</p>

<p>And thus query after query arose in my mind for some length of time,
until at last, tired out, sleep closed my eyelids.</p>

<p>Instead of going to Sunday school on the following morning I went to see
W. H. Scott and related to him what had transpired. He sympathized with
me
in my troubled state, advice to me was:</p>

<p>It afterwards came to my knowledge that my mother had been making
inquiries of her minister and members of the Wesleyan Reformers in regard

to what kind of people the "Mormons" were and what was their belief; and

the false statements she received in reply accounted for the unkind
answer
she gave me.</p>

<p>I went to the Latter day Saints' meeting whenever opportunity offered,
but was very cautious not to inform my parents.</p>

<p>Sometimes I attended meetings at Eston and Stockton (both places being
about four miles from home) as well as at Middlesbrough.</p>

<p>I soon left my former Sunday school and began attending another of the
same persuasion, but differing on some points of doctrine. Then I
attended
the Unitarian school, where their exercises partook of a secular as well
as
of a religious nature. From there I went to the Wesleyans; but wherever I

roamed no true spiritual enjoyment could be found as at the meetings of
the
Latter-day Saints.</p>



<h2><a name="1chap3">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="chapterHeading">A COMPANION&mdash;HOW I SAVED MY EMIGRATION MONEY
&mdash;AN IMPORTANT LETTER FROM AMERICA.</p>

<p>My acquaintance with the Sedgwick family, which had been interrupted as
related in a previous chapter, was again renewed in the Summer of 1863.
From that time the friendship existing between Richard, and myself was of

the most intimate character. It was not long before the subject of
"Mormonism" was broached to Richard, and he was soon convinced of the
truth
of the latter-day gospel. Being also under age he was placed in the same

condition as myself&mdash;neither of us could avail ourselves of the
ordinance of baptism.</p>

<p>Like the rest of the Saints, after embracing the gospel, the spirit of
gathering came strongly upon us, and we felt desirous of emigrating at
some
future day to the land of Zion. In order to do this, it became necessary

for Richard and myself to obtain means for that purpose.</p>

<p>About the latter part of 1862, my employer, Mr. Joseph Gould, purchased
a weekly newspaper, called the <i>Middlesbrough News</i>. It was printed
on
Thursday nights, and necessitated my working most of that night every
week.
The money obtained by overwork enabled me to make deposits in the
Perpetual
Emigration Fund, the first instalment being eleven shillings. This was on

December 15, 1863.</p>

<p>The recollection of the first night's work is still fresh in my memory:
It was till half-past 5 o'clock in the morning, for which I received one

shilling. Just think of it, boys! For ten hours' work I received
twenty-four cents&mdash;all in cash! Would you not think "hard times" had

come again if you had to labor so long for such a small amount,
especially
if you were endeavoring to save means to emigrate? From this time my
employer agreed to pay me three halfpence an hour&mdash;three cents.
Shortly after it was raised to twopence (four cents); then to threepence

(six cents). The latter was the highest amount received by me for
overwork.
</p>

<p>Besides the money earned by overwork, I had a little pocket money given
me out of my weekly wages. My mother was not aware that I devoted these
means for emigration purposes, but had an idea I had some money saved up.

It was the usual custom to go to town on Saturday evenings, and she
believed a portion of my gains was spent there. In this she judged
wrongly.
</p>

<p>My companion, Richard, was working for Mr. Carter, the picture-frame
maker. He, like myself, was saving money for the same purpose. He put
away
most of what he received from his parents as pocket money, and sometimes

earned a little by overwork.</p>

<p>From the time my mother forbade my associating with the "Mormons" till
the Spring of 1866 (three years) was an unpleasant period of my life. It
is
true the meetings of the Saints were times of refreshing to me, for I
loved
my religion; but the fear that my parents would discover my attachment to

the Latter-day Saints was ever a source of dread. My home was no longer a

home to me. Disobedience to my mother's wishes was ever a sore
affliction.
</p>

<p>Whenever there was an opportunity for my companion and myself to attend
a Latter-day Saint meeting, we did so; but when we had not that
privilege,
if the weather was fine, we visited the cemetery, the docks, or other
places of interest in Middlesbrough and vicinity. These were days which
will not easily be forgotten.</p>

<p>In the early part of February, 1866, my mother received a letter from
America, which stated that some of her relatives were desirous our family

should come to reside with them, and intimated they would send our
passage
money to cross the ocean.</p>

<p>This was good news to my mother, as she was very anxious, and had been
for some time, to go to that land. She was the only one of her father's
family remaining in England, the rest having previously emigrated.</p>

<p>There was one thing which prevented our family from emigrating: I had
three more years of my apprenticeship to serve. In an interview between
Mr.
Gould and my mother respecting canceling my indentures, he declined doing

so. Under these circumstances it was thought best for the family to
remain
for a season.</p>

<p>Poor woman! She little contemplated that for the last three years and a
half I had been carefully saving means to emigrate to Utah, and intended
to
leave the coming Spring!</p>

<p class="chapterHeading">RICHARD AND MYSELF DETERMINE TO EMIGRATE WITH THE
SAINTS&mdash;RECEIVE BAPTISM&mdash;THE NOTIFICATION PAPERS&mdash;FIRST
ATTEMPT TO LEAVE HOME.</p>

<p>In the Spring of 1866, Richard Sedgwick and myself fully resolved to
leave our homes and emigrate to Utah. I had managed to get means enough
to
take me to the frontier, where the mule and ox teams started to cross the

plains to Salt Lake. Richard had only sufficient to take him to New York,

where he expected to stay awhile and then proceed to Utah. The time for
our
departure was drawing near, and we very anxiously looked forward to it
with
great interest.</p>

<p>As it was my intention to soon leave for Utah, it was deemed advisable
by President Littlefair that I should get baptized. Accordingly, on the
morning of March 24, 1866, in the River Tees, that ordinance was attended

to by Elder John Scott; and I was confirmed by President Littlefair in
the
afternoon.</p>

<p>My parents knew nothing about it. Nearly every Sunday morning I was in
the habit of going early for milk to a small village called Newport. That

morning I proceeded as usual, taking with me a small tin bucket. I went
to
the residence of the Scott family and called for William and others of
the
family. Richard also accompanied us. On starting out, it commenced to
rain,
but by the time we arrived at the river side it cleared up. About half a

dozen were present. After singing a hymn, prayer was offered and baptism

was performed. Another hymn was sung and we started homeward, chatting
pleasantly together.</p>

<p>Richard was baptized a few days later. Arrangements were made that
William, Richard and myself should sail on the third ship that season,
the
<i>American Congress</i>, and accordingly we sent our deposit money to
secure a berth on that vessel. Every day we were expecting our
notification
papers, which would inform us what day the ship would start. They came on

the 13th of May of that year.</p>

<p>We held meeting that day at Sister Jane Scott's, at whose house the
meetings were held from the time the Scott family arrived in
Middlesbrough,
in 1863. Just prior to the arrival of Thomas Watson, clerk of the branch,
I
was remarking on the heat of the room. On his entry, William H. Scott
asked
him:</p>

<p>"Have you brought the <i>Millennial Stars?</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Brother Watson, "and the notification papers, too."</p>

<p>As soon as he uttered these words a nervous feeling crept over me; I
felt cold and went to the fire place to warm me.</p>

<p>We held our usual testimony meeting, and among those who bore testimony
to the truth of the latter-day work I was one, and while doing so the
tears
trickled down my cheeks.</p>

<p>The notification papers stated that the <i>American Congress</i> would
sail from London on the 23rd of May, which gave us ten days' notice.</p>

<p>A day or two after this William H. Scott received a letter, stating that
a small company of Saints would leave Sunderland by steamer on the next
Saturday morning, May 19th, for London, from which place the <i>American

Congress</i> had to leave on the 23rd of that month. We thought this
would
be a good opportunity to go on this route, as it was much cheaper by this

means than by rail. To do this we would have to leave Middlesbrough on
the
evening of May 18th, five days before the ship would sail.</p>

<p>We were in a rather peculiar situation, and wondered what excuse we
could give our parents and employers to be absent a few days without them

suspecting our intentions.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, our right-hand man, William H. Scott, received a
letter from President Brigham Young, Jr., at Liverpool, assigning him a
mission. This was unpleasant news to both Richard and myself, for to
start
on our journey without him was almost like being left without a
shepherd.
</p>

<p>As it could not be avoided, however, we determined to make the best of
it and leave on Friday evening, the 18th.</p>

<p>On Wednesday evening, the 16th, I broached the subject of being away two
days. I told my parents I wished to go with Richard Sedgwick to
Hartlepool
the following Friday, on a visit to some of his friends, and return on
the
following Sunday evening. My father was a little opposed to my going, but

my mother was favorably inclined. Hartlepool was about twelve miles from

Middlesbrough, and Sunderland was over forty.</p>

<p>Having secured the consent of my parents to be away from home two days,
the next thing was to see my employer. It so happened that we were very
busy at the printing business, and to ask for a holiday would be almost
absurd. We were bent on leaving on the Friday night, and go we must. But

what bothered me most was what excuse I could give my employer to be
away.
To tell him the same story as I had told my parents would hardly do, as
he
might say I could go there some other time when we were not quite so
busy.
Finally, on Thursday, the 17th, I saw Mr. Gould and told him I wished to
go
and see some of my relatives at Bradford, who were going to remove from
that place and desired to see me before they left. I asked leave of
absence
from 4 o'clock Friday evening till Monday morning. Mr. Gould granted my
request.</p>

<p>It was much easier for Richard to get permission to be away a few days
than it was for me. He told his parents and his employer that he wanted
to
go to Hartlepool, and his wish was granted without any particular
questions
being asked.</p>

<p>After Mr. Gould granted my request, he paid me my full week's wages and
gave me a shilling for pocket money. He was in the habit of giving me
sixpence a week as pocket money, but this time he was kind enough to give

me double the amount. I thanked him for his kindness. Mr. Gould had been

kind to me ever since I entered his employ, and now that I was about to
leave him, expecting never more to see him again, reflections of an
unpleasant nature crossed my mind.</p>

<p>On reaching home I quickly put on my Sunday clothes and was soon ready
to start, but became so confused as to forget to bid the folks good-by.
Just as I was near the door, my mother said:</p>

<p>"What! are you going off without bidding us good-by?"</p>

<p>I turned quickly around and said:</p>

<p>"Good-by! Good-by!"</p>

<p>They watched me as I left the door. I hurried on my journey and was soon
out of sight.</p>

<p class="chapterHeading">ARRIVAL AT SUNDERLAND&mdash;ON THE STEAMER
"GENERAL HAVELOCK"&mdash;IN LONDON&mdash;ON BOARD THE "AMERICAN
CONGRESS"
&mdash;UNPLEASANT NEWS&mdash;A MEETING OF THE SAINTS&mdash;AN AWFUL
SURPRISE
&mdash;"I WANT YOU!"&mdash;TAKEN PRISONERS.</p>

<p>I went down to a steamboat landing, crossed the River Tees in a small
steamer and waited there nearly half an hour, when Richard came. He
brought
with him our box, which contained a bed-quilt, some books and other
articles.</p>

<p>On this side of the river was the Port Clarence railway station, where,
after securing our tickets, we took the train for Sunderland.</p>

<p>We arrived at the latter place about 7:30 p.m. After some little trouble
we found President George J. Linford, who was staying at a Brother
Inglefield's. We procured lodgings for the night, for which we paid
fourpence (eight cents) each.</p>

<p>Early next morning we went on board the steamer <i>General Havelock</i>.
Quite a number of Saints (between fifty and sixty) embarked on the
steamer;
they hailed from Newcastle, Sunderland and other places.</p>

<p>About 8 o'clock the steamer started. It was pleasant sailing. This was
the first time we had been on sea. Richard and I enjoyed ourselves and
felt
very happy. We were pleased to be away from home and soon made intimate
acquaintance with the Saints, finding among them many good-hearted
people.
We had some interesting conversation which helped to pass away the time.
</p>

<p>The following day we arrived in the great metropolis&mdash;London&mdash;
about half-past 2 o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p>During the forenoon of the next day President Linford informed us we
could go on board the <i>American Congress</i>, but said he did not know

whether we could sail on that vessel or not. He told us that shortly
after
we left Sunderland on the Saturday morning, a telegram came there from
Brigham Young, Jr., asking him not to let the Saints start, but for them
to
wait till the next ship was ready.</p>

<p>In the evening of that day, President Linford went to Liverpool to see
Brother Young and make final arrangements about sailing.</p>

<p>This was rather unpleasant news to Richard and myself, for if we could
not go with that ship, it would be expensive to wait two or three weeks
till the next vessel started; in fact, we did not have means to do so.
Not
only this, but we were in suspense about being away, for we were afraid
we
might be captured and taken back to our homes.</p>

<p>In the forenoon of that day we went down to St. Catherine's Docks and
got on board the <i>American Congress</i>.</p>

<p>The next morning Bro. Barker Childs, one of the Saints who sailed with
us from Sunderland, asked me a rather curious question. Said he:</p>

<p>"What would you think if you were taken off the ship?"</p>

<p>I replied: "I don't know."</p>

<p>Shortly after this, President Linford came.</p>

<p>"Good morning," said Barker.</p>

<p>"Good morning," responded Linford.</p>

<p>"Well," said Barker, "what's the news? Have we to stay here or not?"
</p>

<p>"You can go with this vessel," replied President Linford.</p>

<p>This was good news to all of us who had sailed from Sunderland, and we
felt to rejoice when he told us.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon of Wednesday the ship was towed down the river to
Shadwell Basin, and word was passed around that she would sail early next

morning.</p>

<p>About 7 o'clock in the evening a meeting of the Saints was held on the
deck. There were some good, soul-stirring hymns sung, and addresses were

delivered by Elders John Nicholson and N. H. Felt.</p>

<p>While the services were in progress quite a crowd of spectators were
viewing us from the shore, and among them was a short, stout man, who
gazed
intently at Richard and I.</p>

<p>After the meeting was over we both went below to our bunk, where we
anxiously awaited the morrow to come, when we would be out on the ocean
beyond all danger of pursuit. The ship was well filled with passengers
&mdash;every berth being taken.</p>

<p>Early next morning we were up in good time. I walked about the cabin and
on the deck with a feeling of gloom over me. I told Richard of my
foreboding of something unpleasant, but what it was I could not tell. The

sailors were busy preparing for the long voyage, and we expected soon to

start.</p>

<p>About half past 7 o'clock I went off the ship to get a supply of water.
Returning, I came near to where Richard was on deck, and said:</p>

<p>"Here's the water; now let's go and get breakfast."</p>

<p>No sooner had I said these words than a noise occurred in the gangway,
and the next moment a voice cried out:</p>

<p>"That's one of them!"</p>

<p>I had hardly time to turn around when a rough hand seized me by the
collar. The next words I heard were:</p>

<p>"I want you!"</p>

<p>The person who spoke first was Mr. Thomas Carter, Richard's employer;
the other speaker was a London detective, the man who watched us so
closely
the night previous at the meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter then, in a quick tone, enquired:</p>

<p>"Where's Richard?"</p>

<p>"He is there," I replied, pointing towards him as he stood close by, an
eye-witness to what was going on.</p>

<p>The detective then seized him and pulled him towards me, taking from his
breast coat pocket two summonses.</p>

<p>"Robert Aveson," said he to me, "Is that your name?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was my answer.</p>

<p>"And Richard Sedgwick?"</p>

<p>Richard responded to his name.</p>

<p>"You have absconded from your apprenticeship," continued the detective.
"You thought no one could catch you, did you?"</p>

<p>I replied, "No."</p>

<p>Mr. Carter then asked Richard if he had any luggage, who replied in the
negative.</p>

<p>I quickly said, "I have."</p>

<p>Then we all went down into the cabin together.</p>



<h2><a name="1chap6">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="chapterHeading">THE SCENE IN THE CABIN&mdash;ONE OF THE SAINTS
DEFENDS US AND IS THREATENED&mdash;JOHN NICHOLSON, PRESIDENT OF THE
COMPANY, COMES FORWARD&mdash;THE PARTING SCENE&mdash;GOOD BY TO THE
SAINTS
&mdash;TAKEN TO THE THAMES POLICE OFFICE&mdash;TRYING TO GET THE PASSAGE

MONEY&mdash;LOCKED IN THE CELL.</p>

<p>On making our appearance in the cabin, the Saints rushed up to see what
was the matter, and in a few seconds a large crowd gathered around. I
jumped up in our bunk, commenced to get our things together and put in
our
box what articles I could.</p>

<p>One of the Saints, named Isaac Sutliffe, said to the detective:</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with these boys?"</p>

<p>The response came from the officer in a sharp tone:</p>

<p>"We're going to take them away with us."</p>

<p>"No you ain't," said Sutliffe in an emphatic manner</p>

<p>After further argument the detective said to Sutliffe:</p>

<p>"If you don't hush up we'll take you, too."</p>

<p>At this juncture, John Nicholson, president of the company, came forward
and asked what was the matter.</p>

<p>The detective answered:</p>

<p>"We are going to take these boys away because they have absconded from
their apprenticeship."</p>

<p>The officer then produced the papers and showed them to Brother
Nicholson, who, after reading them, said:</p>

<p>"That's all right. I did not know anything about the boys."</p>

<p>The officer then asked for our passage money. Brother Nicholson replied:
</p>

<p>"I cannot give you it; but the boys can get it by going to President
Young's office at Islington."</p>

<p>Our ship tickets were then endorsed by Brother Nicholson, to the effect
that the passage money had to be given to no one but the boys (Richard
and
myself).</p>

<p>Having our luggage ready for starting we disposed of our ship outfit to
two of the Saints, the cost of which was about five shillings. We began
to
shake hands with the Saints, many of whom, with tears in their eyes, bade

us a sad "good-by." While thus engaged the detective seized me by the
collar and pulling me towards the steps, said:</p>

<p>"Come along, we can't wait for you!"</p>

<p>With aching hearts away we went with our box, accompanied by Carter and
the detective. Our destination was the Thames Police Office, which was
about a mile distant. On arriving there, Carter and the detective left as

soon as they had ordered breakfast for us.</p>

<p>There were two men in charge of the office, who took quite an interest
in us and treated us very kindly.</p>

<p>Considering all things, the morning passed away very well. Something
seemed to be whispering within me, "It's all for the best." I told
Richard
so, and he said he felt the same.</p>

<p>We were made to feel worse by hearing a number of church bells ringing
merrily, and upon enquiring the cause were informed it was the
anniversary
of the queen's birthday. The morning seemed a long one, and when dinner
time came we were provided with a good meal of roast beef, potatoes,
etc.
</p>

<p>In the early afternoon we were taken in a hack to the office of
President B. Young, Jr., at Islington, by Mr. Carter and the detective,
whose object in taking us there was to endeavor to get our passage money

and use it in paying the expenses of taking us back to our homes.</p>

<p>As we approached the office the detective asked for our ship tickets. I
told him I would not give them up. There were three tickets&mdash;two to

take us across the ocean, the other to take me to Wyoming, Nebraska.</p>

<p>Again the officer asked me for the tickets, which I still refused to
give up. He said he would soon return them to me. On that condition I
handed them to him with many misgivings. It was a severe trial to be
taken
back home; but to lose our hard-earned savings as well we felt keenly.</p>



<p>Arriving at our destination, inquiry was made for Brother Young, but we
were informed that he was not there. We were invited in and told to wait
a
few minutes, when some gentlemen would see us; and soon Elders N. H.
Felt,
George Linford and other brethren made their appearance.</p>

<p>The officer then told them he wished to get the money for the ship
tickets, whereupon the brethren returned to another room to hold council.

In a few minutes they came and said that Brigham Young had gone to
Liverpool, but if the boys (Richard and myself) would send their tickets
to
George J. Linford at Sunderland the money would be refunded. We were then

taken back to the police office.</p>

<p>While on the way back, Carter got out of the hack. After he had gone the
detective drew close to us and said he did not want us to think any the
less of him for the part he had taken, as he had only done his duty. I
told
him it was all right, we knew it.</p>

<p>We arrived at the police office between 4 and 5 o'clock and shortly
afterwards had our supper, after which I wrote a letter to George J.
Linford and inclosed the three tickets. Just as it was finished, one of
the
men in charge of the jail said:</p>

<p>"Come, mates, we must do our duty; you'll have to go into the cell."
</p>

<p>"All right," said I, and then asked him to post our letter, and he said
he would.</p>

<p>We were then escorted into a cell. Some bed clothes were given us and we
were told that anyone else would not have been allowed this privilege.
They
said if we wanted anything we were to shout for it. So they locked us up

and went away.</p>



<h2><a name="1chap7">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="chapterHeading">HOW THE TIME WAS SPENT IN THE CELL&mdash;A TRUE
TESTIMONY&mdash;AN OFFICER FROM MIDDLESBROUGH&mdash;HANDCUFFED&mdash;
LEAVE
LONDON&mdash;ARRIVAL AT MIDDLESBROUGH&mdash;THE POLICE OFFICE.</p>

<p>It was a small cell built of rock, with stationary scats around it. In
the middle of the door was a square hole, with an extended ledge, where
eatables, etc., could be passed through.</p>

<p>All was quiet, no noise, not even the ticking of a clock, could be
heard. There was no light save the glimmer of the gas from the passage
way
outside the cell.</p>

<p>We were alone and felt sad and rather low-spirited. We conversed but
little. I walked up and down the cell; Richard laid down and tried to
sleep. This was a hard thing for him to do, as his thoughts troubled him.

Oh, how I lifted my heart heavenward and prayed most fervently to my
Heavenly Father to comfort us in our hour of trial! Presently I heard
footsteps, and a voice at the door asked:</p>

<p>"Do you want anything, mates?"</p>

<p>I answered, "No."</p>

<p>Poor fellow! It was one of the keepers. They evidently felt for us, for
they came two or three times and asked the same question. Then I laid
down
and tried to sleep, but could not.</p>

<p>We had been in the cell perhaps two hours, when a heavenly influence
rested upon us. I said to Richard:</p>

<p>"How do you feel?"</p>

<p>He replied, "I feel happy."</p>

<p>I told him I never felt so happy in all my life as at that moment, and
remarked I did not care how long we remained in the cell if we could feel

like that all the time.</p>

<p>It was the holy influence of the Spirit of the Lord that rested upon us.
To us it was a testimony that the gospel we had embraced was true. Our
minds became calm and we were strengthened in that hour of trial. At last

sleep closed our eyes. Thus ended a very eventful day of our lives.</p>

<p>About half-past 5 next morning our breakfast was handed to us through
the small, square hole in the door&mdash;bread and butter and coffee. We

tasted the coffee, but did not like it; so I asked the keeper to give us

some water, which he did.</p>

<p>About 6 o'clock, the cell door was opened and there stood before us an
officer from Middlesbrough, a gentleman whom we had seen before. He
produced a pair of handcuffs and put them on our wrists. This indignity
we
felt most keenly. My wrists were so thin the handcuffs were almost too
large and they nearly slipped over my hand. He told us to follow him,
which
we did, and as we passed through the police office, we bade the keepers
good-by. Their kindness towards us is still treasured up by me, and if
ever
the pleasure of meeting them again presents itself, it will be a source
of
happiness to shake them by the hand and thank them for past favors.</p>

<p>A hack was waiting in front of the office, which we got into and started
for the railway which would take us to Middlesbrough.</p>

<p>A little while after the train had started the handcuffs were removed
from our wrists. To pass the time away we amused ourselves looking out of

the car windows and viewing passing objects and did all we could to make

them think we did not care for being taken back to our homes; but could
the
secrets of our bosoms have been revealed, two aching hearts would have
been
discovered.</p>

<p>Before the train reached its destination the "bracelets" were again
placed on our hands. We arrived at Middlesbrough about a quarter to 8 in

the evening. Before getting out of the cars we pulled our coat sleeves
over
the handcuffs, and as soon as we were out in the station, we swung our
hands, kept a smile on our countenances and were scarcely noticed by
anyone, till we arrived at the Middlesbrough police office. No sooner had

we entered the office than one of the officers in charge inquired:</p>

<p>"Are you the boys that have been brought back?"</p>

<p>I answered, "Yes."</p>

<p>He said, "You were not worth bringing back," which sentiment found an
echo in my own heart.</p>



<h2><a name="1chap8">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chapterHeading">IN THE CELL&mdash;A VISIT FROM RICHARD'S FATHER
AND MY MOTHER&mdash;THE TRIAL&mdash;THE DECISION OF THE COURT&mdash;A FEW

WORDS OF EXPLANATION.</p>

<p>We were soon escorted to a cell, which was much larger and colder than
the one we occupied the night previous. The handcuffs taken off, the door

closed upon us, and with sad hearts we sat down upon a bed of straw.</p>

<p>We had been in the cell but a few minutes when Richard's father came
with some supper for his son. How sad he looked as he entered the cell
&mdash;a father's love for his boy was clearly manifest. He did not say
much, but looked hard at me, as though he blamed me for leading him from

home. Of course I was a few months older than Richard, but he was taller

and stouter than I, and to look at us it would hardly appear reasonable
that I should have power to lead him away. Mr. Sedgwick only stayed a few

moments.</p>

<p>The supper was soon spread. Richard, poor fellow, could not eat, but I
did justice to my share. We then laid down and tried to sleep, but what
with the mice and other small visitors, and thinking of our peculiar
situation, we had little sleep that night, and were not sorry when
daylight
came.</p>

<p>About 8 o'clock the next morning my mother entered the cell with some
breakfast for me. She did not say much but evidently felt for me. It was

principally through her we had been brought back. Though one of the prime

movers in our capture, she was hardly to blame, for she believed it was
her
duty to do what she had done. So many tales had been told her concerning

Utah and the "Mormons" that she felt positive there must be a great deal
of
truth in them.</p>

<p>About half-past 10 o'clock we were escorted into a room where an officer
took a description of us&mdash;color of our hair, eyes, complexion, our
height, etc. Shortly afterwards we were taken into the court room and had

our trial before Judge Fallows. Besides the judge and several policemen,

our employers, Richard's father and my mother were there.</p>

<p>The judge asked a few questions and then inquired what we had to say for
ourselves. I immediately arose and said:</p>

<p>"What I have to say for myself is this: The room I work in is not a fit
place, as it is a cold, damp cellar."</p>

<p>Mr. Gould denied this statement.</p>

<p>The judge then asked Richard what he had to say for himself. He replied
that his reason for absconding was because we were such close companions,

and when I ran away he followed me. One of the police said to me:</p>

<p>"You're the leader, then, are you?"</p>

<p>We were then asked by the judge whether we would serve the remainder of
our apprenticeship in jail, or go back and work for our employers. We
chose
the latter alternative.</p>

<p>He then inquired of Mr. Carter what our expenses were and the amount of
our passage money. On being informed, he decided that if our employers
could obtain the money for our ship tickets it would clear the incurred
expenses; but if not, the expenses were to be deducted out of our wages,

and the case was dismissed. At this we were not sorry. I went home; but
as
my parents were not there I went to see Wm. H. Scott.</p>

<p>Before proceeding further, it may be proper to offer a few words
concerning our capture. When we did not return to our homes at the time
appointed, suspicion was immediately aroused and Mr. Carter told Mr.
Gould
and our parents he believed we were connected with the "Mormons," and had

run away with the intention of going by a vessel that was to sail for
America. They at once telegraphed to London to see if the ship had
started
and were informed it had not.</p>

<p>Our parents were anxious we should be brought back, and my mother begged
they would send for us. She said she would do anything rather than have
us
go to Utah with the "Mormons." Mr. Gould was not much in favor of taking

any steps; but Mr. Carter felt quite interested in the matter. He
telegraphed to London and had a detective put on our track, and started
himself for London that evening and arrived there early next morning,
when,
accompanied by a detective, he took us off the ship as already narrated.
</p>

<p>To again continue the story. I spent the Saturday afternoon after our
trial with Wm. H. Scott, who had not yet gone on his mission. He informed

us that while we were absent he had had an unpleasant time. Both our
parents and employers had suspected him of being the cause of our
absconding, and not seeing him in Middlesbrough, they thought he had gone

with us; but in this they were mistaken, as William, thinking they would

suspect him, went to Stockton and stayed there a few days. After this
interview I went home and was treated very kindly by my parents that
evening.</p>

<p class="chapterHeading">A CLIPPING FROM THE "MIDDLESBROUGH NEWS"&mdash;A
PROMISE MADE BUT NOT FULFILLED&mdash;THE SECOND ATTEMPT TO LEAVE HOME.</p>



<p>After my return home I thought seriously over the matter of absconding.
I knew I had broken the law and also the promise I had made in my
indentures to work seven years with Mr. Gould. Had my parents been more
favorable towards me, I should not have left my home and employer to
endeavor to emigrate with the Saints until I was free to act upon my own

responsibility, and to do as I thought best. But now that I was back
again,
it was my resolve to stay and finish the remainder of my apprenticeship,

providing my parents would grant me permission to attend meetings of the

Saints and not be too strict with me.</p>

<p>As Richard and I passed along the streets, people made scornful remarks
about us.</p>

<p>On the next Friday, June 1st, my attention was called to the following
article, which appeared in the <i>Middlesbrough News</i>, published that

morning:</p>

<p>"SATURDAY.&mdash;Before W. Fallows, Esq.</p>

<p>"OFF TO MORMONDOM.&mdash;At this court, two youths, named Richard
Sedgwick and Robert Aveson, the former an apprentice with Mr. Carter of
Gosford Street, and the latter with Mr. Gould of South Street, printer,
were charged with absconding on the 18th ult. The lads, in company with a

young man who has joined the Mormons and succeeded in converting the lads

to his views, went from Sunderland and from thence to London by the
steamer
<i>Lady Havelock, en route</i> for Utah. A warrant was sent after them,
and
they were apprehended in London and brought back to Middlesbrough.&mdash;

Ordered to go back to their work, and the expenses to be deducted out of

their wages."</p>

<p>The next day, after finishing my work at 4 o'clock, Mr. Gould brought my
week's wages, but instead of my usual seven shillings and sixpence he
gave
me five shillings and sixpence. He said he was going to deduct two
shillings per week until the full amount of my expenses from London was
paid. This did not meet my approval, but as it was according to the
decision of the court it could not be prevented.</p>

<p>On the following Sunday, shortly after dinner, I told my parents I
wished to go for a walk. Permission was granted, but my father
accompanied
me.</p>

<p>Richard Sedgwick's parents did not take the same course with him as my
parents did with me. He could attend any meetings he wished and was
permitted to go where he pleased; but a strict watch was kept over me by
my
mother, so that I was always in a miserable suspense. Besides this, my
mother was all the time talking to me when I was at home, which made me
dread to see her.</p>

<p>On Saturday, June 9th, my mother asked me to go with her next day to a
meeting of the Wesleyan Reformers.</p>

<p>"Mother," I replied, "I can't serve two religions at once."</p>

<p>"Yours is the devil's religion!" she replied.</p>

<p>The next morning, on going to my trunk to get on my Sunday clothes, I
discovered they were not there, and on asking my mother where they were,

she said:</p>

<p>"Those clothes you wear every day are good enough for you to go to
Mormon meetings in."</p>

<p>Pleased to think she would allow me to go even on those terms, I
answered that it did not matter with me what kind of clothes I had on so

long as the privilege was granted of attending "Mormon" meetings.</p>

<p>After breakfast, I went to the front door and sat on the step
meditating, while people passed to and fro, dressed in their Sunday
clothes. Then I looked at myself in my everyday attire, with no coat on,
as
mine was not to be had. It seemed to touch me on a sore part to go
through
the streets in my shirt sleeves, while all others were dressed in their
best clothes. But I revered my religion, loved the Saints and was not
going
to stay in the house all day notwithstanding the clothes worn by me were

shabby for the Sabbath.</p>

<p>The church bells were pealing and the people passing to and fro to their
respective places of worship as I hurried to my place of destination
&mdash;
Sister Scott's&mdash;and related to the folks there how my Sunday clothes

had been locked up by my mother. From one of the Saints, a young man
living
at Scott's, I obtained the loan of a coat. They asked me to come to the
afternoon meeting, to be held at their house, which I promised to do.</p>



<p>Returning home about noon, my father commanded that I should stay in the
house the remainder of the day. So I was prevented keeping my promise.</p>



<p>That afternoon was one of the most unpleasant of my life. Oh, how slowly
the time passed away! I retired early to rest. My prayers were not
forgotten; and while on my knees big tears rolled down my cheeks.</p>

<p>Richard and I intended to make our second attempt to leave home; but
prior to doing so awaited an answer to a letter which had been sent to
President George J. Linford while in the Thames Police office; containing

our ship tickets. But three weeks passed away before the expected answer

came.</p>

<p>On Saturday evening, June 16th, we received a letter from President
Linford. It informed us that our tickets had been received all right and

contained his advice to us not to again run away from our homes, but
serve
out our lawful apprenticeship.</p>

<p>The next day was the time fixed to leave our homes the second time. We
intended to start at 5 o'clock in the afternoon by steamer for Shields, a

town probably between forty or fifty miles northward.</p>

<p>In the morning of that day I attended the Presbyterian church, and it
seemed to me my mother was beginning to think I was weaning myself from
"Mormonism."</p>

<p>In the afternoon, Richard and I went to Sister Scott's. There we met
some of her relatives from Shields. One of them, a young lady, not
intending to return that day, gave me her ticket.</p>

<p>One or two acquaintances of Sister Scott were going to Shields, and we
intended, on arriving there, to stay with them that night. Where our
final
destination would be we hardly knew, though we had been thinking of going

to some part of Scotland. Richard had about 1.2s. ($5.50). I had no
money,
but had borrowed 5s. ($1.25) from Sister Scott.</p>

<p>About half past 4 o'clock we went down to a boat landing, accompanied by
nearly all of the Scott family and visiting relatives, who were going to

Shields. The steamer we intended to go by was timed to leave at 5
o'clock;
a steamer for Stockton also started at the same time. Both the steamers
were moored near each other. We were there a few minutes before 5 o'clock

and went with our friends into a waiting room on the landing stage.
Passengers were walking about the landing, awaiting the departure of the

steamers. It was our intention to go aboard the Shields steamer; but
before
doing so we noticed a man named Brooks, a printer, going on the Stockton

steamer. Being acquainted with him, we deemed it advisable to wait till
the
Stockton steamer should start, for fear Brooks would see us going on the

other steamer. This placed us in a rather precarious situation, as both
steamers having to start at the same time, we were afraid of being unable

to get on the vessel without his seeing us. Anxiously we watched the two

boats, wondering which would start first, when we saw the Stockton boat
make the first move. How pleased we were! It had not got many feet away
when, turning to Richard, I said quickly:</p>

<p>"Now, let us go!" (meaning, of course, for us to go on the Shield's
steamer.)</p>

<p>No sooner had I spoken these words than a brother in the Church, named
John Parish, hurriedly approached us and in a half whisper, said:</p>

<p>"<i>Here's your mother!</i>"</p>

<p>These words perplexed and astounded me. Was it a reality that we were
stopped the second time in our attempt to leave home? To be positive that

Parish was correct in his assertion I looked in the direction he pointed,

and there, sure enough, was my mother gazing intently at the two
steamers
&mdash;one on its journey and the other just ready to start.</p>

<p class="chapterHeading">PLANNING TO LEAVE HOME A THIRD TIME&mdash;LEAVE
MIDDLESBROUGH&mdash;ARRIVAL AT NEWCASTLE&mdash;LEITH, EDINBURGH AND
GLASGOW
&mdash;A PECULIAR SITUATION: NO MONEY, NO FRIENDS&mdash;MAKE UP MY MIND
TO
GO TO NEW YORK&mdash;ARRIVAL AT LIVERPOOL.</p>

<p>I left the waiting room and returned home with my mother.</p>

<p>It was my usual habit to be at home at 4 o'clock on Sundays, but being
absent at that time on this occasion, my mother, thinking it probable I
was
going to a Latter-day Saint evening meeting at Stockton by steamer, came
to
the boat landing to look for me.</p>

<p>The next morning my mind was fully set to make a third attempt to leave
home.</p>

<p>At dinner time, seeing Richard a little ahead of me on the street, I
quickly overtook him and said:</p>

<p>"Now, Richard, make up your mind to go away to-night."</p>

<p>He was surprised, and said:</p>

<p>"We have been stopped twice now, and I don't think it's right for us to
go away again; but I'll go with you if you want me to."</p>

<p>We then arranged to meet at the theatre, which was near a boat landing,
at 7:30 that evening; he agreeing to bring with him out of my box (which

was at Sister Scott's), a tin cup, some writing paper, envelopes, and pen

and ink.</p>

<p>The working hours in the printing office were from 8 a.m. till 7:30 p.m.
The train by which I intended to leave had to start at 7:45 p.m.</p>

<p>Shortly after 7 o'clock that evening it began to rain. The suit I wore
was very thin and I would soon be wet through. I discovered also that a
new
pocket knife, recently purchased, had been left behind; so, thinking of
the
rain, my poor clothes and the knife, I was in two minds whether to go
that
night or not. I walked up and down the room in which I worked, hardly
knowing what to do. Twenty-five minutes past seven came, but I was still

undecided in my mind.</p>

<p>Presently I left the place and hurried down to where Richard was waiting
near the theatre. He had the things which he was told to bring. Borrowing

twelve shillings from him and, with the five shillings loaned me by
Sister
Scott, my total stock of cash was seventeen shillings.</p>

<p>The rain still continued and my clothes were wet. I parted with my
friend Richard and went on a small steamboat which crossed the river
Tees.
After crossing, I purchased a ticket to Newcastle on-Tyne for three
shillings and a penny and soon boarded the cars and started on my
journey.
</p>

<p>Newcastle was reached about half past 10 o'clock that night. Getting out
of the cars I looked around for a few moments at the elegant and spacious

railway station and began to wonder what was the next thing to do, as it

was my intention to go to Leith next morning. After finding out where the

Leith steamer sailed from I procured lodgings at a private boarding
house.
</p>

<p>At 4 o'clock I was aroused and quickly dressing myself, left the house
and walked the streets for nearly two long hours. About 6 o'clock the
steamer started. We arrived at Leith about 5 o'clock in the evening.
Among
the passengers whose acquaintance I made was an Irishman, bound for
Glasgow; and having the address of the president of the Glasgow
Conference,
I thought it would be best to go there.</p>

<p>We walked from Leith to Edinburgh, about two miles distant, and then
took train for Glasgow, reaching the latter place about 8 o'clock. The
address I wanted to go to was about two miles from the station.</p>

<p>After entering the house I related to the lady there the particulars of
my leaving home, during which time she prepared supper for me. She told
me
she expected Bro. Cluff in soon. Nearly an hour afterward Brother Cluff
came in. They then held a consultation regarding me and Brother Cluff
said
I could say there that night, but they wished me to leave in the
morning.
</p>

<p>Next morning I started out to seek work&mdash;called at printing
offices, paint shops and other places; but after traveling about all day

met with no success.</p>

<p>In the evening I wended my way to the Conference House where they
allowed me to sleep that night.</p>

<p>Next morning I started out again in search of employment. It appeared
strange there should be numerous advertisements for boys wanted in many
stores, but whenever I applied they always made some excuse.</p>

<p>For two long days I had tramped the streets, applying at stores of
various kinds; I was anxious and willing to work but could not obtain
any.
All the money I had borrowed was spent&mdash;every cent&mdash;for
traveling
expenses, food, etc. And here was I in a strange country, without home or

friends, and worst of all, no money. What was I to do? My situation was a

trying one: I had left home, friends and employer, thinking to easily
obtain employment and earn enough, with that deposited with the Perpetual

Emigration Fund to emigrate next year to the frontier.</p>

<p>In the evening I returned as usual to the Conference House, feeling
somewhat low-spirited, but doing my best to cheer myself up and look at
the
bright side.</p>

<p>Conversing with Brother Cluff he asked me why I did not go to New York.
I replied that I might as well stay in Glasgow, because if I went there,
I
should not arrive in time to go with the Saints on the cars to Wyoming,
the
last ship having left three weeks previous.</p>

<p>Brother Cluff informed me that another ship had left Liverpool&mdash;the
<i>St. Mark</i>&mdash;and if I took passage by steamer from Glasgow the
next Saturday, I could get there before the company arrived; and said he

thought it would be likely I should have a chance to go with the Saints
to
the frontier.</p>

<p>Immediately making up my mind to do as Brother Cluff had advised me, I
wrote to Brigham Young, Jr., at Liverpool, asking for my money in the P.
E.
Fund; also to Sister Scott, telling her of my resolve.</p>

<p>On the Saturday morning the postman brought two letters, one of which
was from Liverpool and contained a post office order.</p>

<p>Being too late to secure a berth on the steamer which was to leave
Glasgow that morning, as all the berths were taken, I decided to take the

steamer for Liverpool, which would leave that evening at 6 o'clock, and
sail from there to New York. I purchased several articles of clothing,
and
one of the Saints in the Glasgow branch gave me a hat, shirt, muffler,
etc.
</p>

<p>In the evening, at 6 o'clock, I left Glasgow for Liverpool, which place
we reached late in the afternoon of the next day. I at once proceeded to

Brigham Young's office. There Elder Orson Pratt received me very kindly
and
asked one of the clerks to take me to a lodging house, which he did.</p>

<p>The steamer <i>Virginia</i> was advertised to sail for New York the
following Wednesday, June 27th, and I made arrangements to embark on that

vessel.</p>

<p class="chapterHeading">ARRIVAL AT QUEENSTOWN&mdash;IN SUSPENSE&mdash;
"IT'S ONLY A RUNAWAY BOY THEY'RE AFTER"&mdash;ARRIVAL AT NEW YORK&mdash;A

PROPOSITION ACCEPTED.</p>

<p>Queenstown was reached the next day, June 28th. A small steamer brought
us some Irish passengers, also some officers in search of some one. I
felt
somewhat nervous on seeing them and wondered who they were after. Who did

they want? was it me? Being anxious to ascertain, I inquired of an
Irishwoman who was near me:</p>

<p>"What do these men want?"</p>

<p>The answer she made surprised me.</p>

<p>"It's only a runaway boy they're after."</p>

<p>I was thunderstruck at these words, but still kept my eye on the
officers. At last, seeing them make their way in the direction where I
was,
if it were possible for me to have sunk into the cabin, I should
certainly
have done so. Could I hide? No, there was no time for that.</p>

<p>As they approached near me I sat down, folded my arms and said to
myself: "Take me if you will!" Oh, how my heart beat! Another moment and

they passed by. How thankful I felt it was not me they were after! It
transpired afterwards it was a soldier&mdash;a deserter&mdash;they were
in
search of.</p>

<p>In a very little time we were sailing on the "deep blue sea."</p>

<p>We arrived at New York, July 13th, being sixteen days on our voyage.
</p>

<p>Two or three hours after arriving I started to find out Mr. Thomas
Taylor's office and was kindly invited in. No time was lost by me in
accepting the invitation, as the heat was oppressive. I felt the effects

very much, for no sooner was I seated than faintness overcame me. Some
cold
water and a fan were brought me and I soon recovered. H. P. Folsom, T. B.

H. Stenhouse and others were present. Brother Folsom was formerly
traveling
Elder in the Durham and Newcastle Conference, and I formed his
acquaintance
at Middlesbrough.</p>

<p>After being in the office a few minutes, Brother Folsom asked me if I
was from Middlesbrough, to which I answered in the affirmative. Knowing I

had worked in a printing office, Brother Folsom spoke a good word for me
to
Brother Stenhouse, editor and proprietor of the <i>Salt Lake Daily
Telegraph
</i>, who asked me how long I would work for him if he paid the remainder

of my fare to the frontier. I responded two years. He then said:</p>

<p>"I'll make a proposition to you, Robert: I'll give you twelve dollars a
week for the first year and fifteen for the second."</p>

<p>This proposition was eagerly accepted by me.</p>



<h2><a name="1chap12">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<p class="chapterHeading">LEAVE NEW YORK&mdash;ARRIVAL AT WYOMING&mdash;
INCIDENTS ON THE PLAINS.</p>

<p>I slept that night in the office. The next day Brother H. P. Folsom
procured lodgings for me at Sister Mary I. Worthington's, in Brooklyn,
with
whom I stayed till the next Tuesday, the 17th of June, when, in company
with her and her family, we left New York about midnight.</p>

<p>Our company consisted of about seven hundred Scandinavians (a ship
having arrived on the 17th) and about one hundred English.</p>

<p>On the 29th of July, about noon, we arrived at Wyoming, a small
settlement in Nebraska Territory. At a short distance the tents of the
Saints attracted my attention, and I soon wended my way there, finding
quite a number of those who had sailed in the <i>American Congress</i>.
We
were pleased to greet each other.</p>

<p>After dinner I took a stroll over to one of the stores in the
settlement, where I assisted in serving customers and was given my board
as
a recompense.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon of August 2nd, we started on our long journey.
Our train consisted of about sixty-five wagons. The captain's name was
Rawlings, and Brother John Nicholson was chaplain.</p>

<p>About twenty miles was an average day's journey. The emigrants walked
most of the way, riding only in the wagons at intervals to rest
themselves.
Each morning, before sunrise, we were aroused by the sound of the bugle.

Then could be witnessed a scene of activity; all were bustling around,
some
going for wood, others carrying water and lighting fires.</p>

<p>While camping at night, after supper had been prepared and disposed of,
we enjoyed good times, especially in listening to singing, in which some

young ladies excelled. Groups of elder ones could have been seen seated
around large fires, conversing about days gone by and forecasting the
future.</p>

<p>Following are some incidents which happened on the plains:</p>

<p>Reaching the North Platte River, and after being camped there two or
three hours, one of our company appeared with two loaded guns, one of
which
he hurriedly handed to a young man. We asked what was the matter. He
replied:</p>

<p>"We are surrounded by Indians!"</p>

<p>I then rushed to our wagon to get a pistol which I thought our teamster
had left in the wagon, but could not find it. All the men left camp to
ascertain what was going on. Women and children began to cry and the
scene
was heartrending. Those of us left in camp were eagerly looking around,
expecting every minute to be attacked by Indians. Our camping place was
in
a lonely spot. On one side, close to us, was the North Platte River, and
on
the other, about the same distance, were mountains. Not a house in sight;

in fact, we were a great many miles away from one. We afterwards learned

that the alarm was a false one. The captain called the company together
and
chided the men for leaving the camp without anyone to defend it.</p>

<p>One snowy morning, when probably about a hundred miles from Salt Lake
City, I started out, as usual, on foot. My shoes were considerably worn
out, and one of them was badly used up and so hurt me that, despite the
snow, I had to throw it away and walk barefoot. Approaching our teamster,
I
besought him to let me ride, telling him my deplorable condition. He
refused to grant my request. After walking awhile I again asked
permission
to ride, but was again denied. The snow came down in heavy flakes and
very
few of our company were walking. I trudged along for about three miles
with
only one shoe on, when my strength failed&mdash;I could go no farther
&mdash;
and was about to sit down in the snow, at the same time fervently praying

to my Heavenly Father for His divine assistance. As soon as I had uttered

my prayer a shoe came flying out to me. Our wagon was just passing by and

Sister Worthington was the person who threw it. It was small for me, but

with difficulty, after rubbing some skin off my heel, I managed to get it

on and went limping on my journey.</p>



<h2><a name="1chap13">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chapterHeading">ARRIVAL IN THE "CITY OF THE SAINTS"&mdash;KEEPING
"BACH"&mdash;MY PARENTS JOIN THE CHURCH&mdash;THEY EMIGRATE TO UTAH.</p>

<p>After a long, weary and tedious journey of about seven thousand miles,
Salt Lake City was at length reached on September 30, 1866&mdash;a little

over three months' travel from Liverpool to Salt Lake City. It was Sunday

when we arrived. That morning I arose early, and getting something to
eat,
left the camp (a few miles up Parley's Canyon), and wended my way to the

"City of the Saints," to find the residence of Brother T. B. H.
Stenhouse.
It was a fine, sunny morning; everything around me looked charming and
lovely.</p>

<p>Onward to the heart of the city I went. After many inquiries the
residence of Brother Stenhouse was at length reached. He was pleased to
see
me and invited me to take dinner with himself and family. In the
afternoon
his son, Lorenzo, took me to his father's printing office, which was my
sleeping place that night.</p>

<p>Next morning I went to the Tithing Office yard, where our train was
camped (it having arrived there that morning). President Young came into

the yard to see us. He shook hands with many of the brethren and sisters,

and they felt quite honored. I was informed that a number of the Saints
who
sailed on the <i>American Congress</i> had only arrived in the city a day

or two previous. Although it was over five weeks after the departure of
the
<i>American Congress</i> before my leaving England. I did not lose much
time after all.</p>

<p>I removed what little luggage I had to the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>
office, thinking it best to "keep bach" for the present, as I had no
relatives or any particular friend to board me. This I did for nearly
eleven weeks, when, December 19, 1866, James McKnight, an employe in the
<i>
Daily Telegraph</i> office, told me that if it suited me I could live
with
him. His offer was gladly accepted and I stayed with him for several
months.
</p>

<p>During this time letters regularly reached me from my parents and I was
prompt in answering them; giving full particulars about Salt Lake City
and
our religion, and often bore my testimony to them. I was here in Utah
without a relative and was very desirous they should receive the gospel,

although the prospects were not encouraging at that time.</p>

<p>In August, 1868, Wm. H. Scott arrived from New York (the Scott family
having emigrated to New York in 1867). I was greatly pleased to meet my
friend. He was the first intimate acquaintance from Middlesbrough I had
seen since coming to Utah.</p>

<p>It is painful, however, to relate that he apostatized in the Summer of
1869. It was about the time when the "Godbeite" movement took place. From

the time Brother Scott embraced the gospel he was one of the most zealous

workers in the cause of truth ever seen by me. He labored faithfully to
assist in establishing the latter-day kingdom; but his expectations in
regard to Utah and her people were not realized. I had been very fond of
him
&mdash;had loved him as a brother. He had been a friend and counselor to
me
in past days, and when I saw that he was as much in opposition to the
kingdom of God as he had been formerly in favor of building it up, it
grieved me very much. I talked and reasoned with him and tried to show
him
the error of his way, but it was all in vain. He became more and more
bitterly opposed to the gospel and in the Summer of 1870 went back to the

States.</p>

<p>Correspondence with my parents and also my relatives was regularly kept
up from the time of my arrival in Utah. I was very anxious to induce them

to join the Church, and did all in my power to induce them to do so.</p>

<p>In the Spring of 1879, I procured the address of the president of the
Middlesbrough Branch&mdash;William Garbett&mdash;and wrote to him,
requesting that he should see my parents and use his best endeavors to
induce them to embrace the gospel. Brother Garbett and other Saints
visited
with that object in view.</p>

<p>On the 20th of September, 1879, I was happily surprised and astonished
to receive a letter from my mother with the following glad tidings:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I, your mother, was baptized a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter day Saints, on the 23rd of August, and your father on the 30th of

the same month."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This was very gratifying news, both to myself and wife. After waiting
patiently and anxiously for over thirteen years, my prayers, which were
so
often offered up, were answered.</p>

<p>My reply to this letter from my parents informed them how my heart
rejoiced to hear the good news, and stated that we would assist them to
emigrate to Utah the following year.</p>

<p>The time drew nigh for my parents to arrive in Zion. After such a
lengthy absence from them, and knowing how opposed to the work they had
been, but now their eyes were opened and they could see as I saw, I
looked
forward with pleasure to the day of their arrival.</p>

<p>They took passage with the first company, April 10th, 1880. I almost
counted the days for their arrival. At last it was announced by telegram

that the company would arrive at 6:30, p.m., April 30, 1880. Every
preparation was made by us for their comfort.</p>

<p class="chapterHeading">MY PARENTS IN ZION&mdash;ARRIVAL OF RICHARD
SEDGWICK IN SALT LAKE CITY&mdash;HIS STORY OF LEAVING HOME IN 1867&mdash;

HOW THE PRESIDENT OF THE MIDDLESBROUGH BRANCH WAS EMIGRATED&mdash;
RE-UNION
OF THE MIDDLESBROUGH BRANCH.</p>

<p>The next morning they were enabled to get a better view of he "City of
the Saints." It was the first of May&mdash;a fine sunny day. The orchards

were delightful for the eye to gaze upon; the peach, plum, apple, and
other
trees were arrayed in their sweetest attire. The birds were merry, the
bee
and butterfly passed too and fro, and everything around was beautiful.</p>



<p>My parents were much in love with our city and the surroundings. During
the day father was seen to shed tears&mdash;tears of joy and sorrow. He
was
glad he was here in the land of Zion, but felt sorrowful to think of his

sons and daughter in Babylon. To a neighbor who happened to be near him,

and saw the tears roll down his cheeks, he said he felt sorry to think
that
his children back in England were so foolish to stay there, when they
might
have been here in this beautiful country.</p>

<p>My parents have often expressed, that they wished they had come here
years ago.</p>

<p>About the latter part of October, 1880, I was much pleased to receive a
letter from my brother Miles, at Middlesbrough, stating that he had been

baptized into the Church.</p>

<p>In September, 1881, I sent his fare to emigrate him to Utah, and he
arrived in Salt Lake City, Nov. 11th.</p>

<p>My readers no doubt, have been wondering what became of Richard
Sedgwick. When I bade him good by in England, I little thought so many
years would elapse before we should meet again. After my leaving
Middlesbrough, he stayed there a little over one year, then emigrated to

New York and resided in Brooklyn, at which place he was married in July,

1868. Our correspondence continued more or less, from the time he reached

that place till he arrived in the valleys of the mountains, November 10,

1882. When we met, I should not have known him, nor would he have
recognized me, had I not answered to my name when he inquired for me. It

was nearly sixteen years and a half since we saw each other, and it was a

happy meeting.</p>

<p>The following is Richard Sedgwick's account of his leaving home in 1867:
</p>

<p>"I started from home on the 1st of July, 1867. It was on a Monday
morning, and on Mondays we used to commence work at 8 o'clock, while
other
mornings, we began at 6. I took the train for Stockton (four miles away),

and on arriving there called at the house of Brother Thomas Watson, clerk

of the Middlesbrough and Stockton branch. The box, which we had with us
when we left our homes the year previous, was at Brother Watson's house.
I
told him I wanted it, as it was my intention to go to Liverpool, and from

there to New York. Brother Watson was not in favor of my going away, and

advised me to return home, but my mind was bent on leaving for New York
and
then get to Utah as soon as possible. He kept talking with me till I
missed
the train for Liverpool. This was unpleasant, as I was afraid Mr. Carter

would send an officer after me.</p>

<p>"Determined not to be baffled, I took my box, went to the station and
waited for the next train, perhaps two hours, and arrived at Liverpool
about 2 o'clock in the afternoon. It so happened that a steamer had to
leave for New York early next morning. I went to 42 Islington, and got my

passage money which I had paid to sail on the <i>American Congress</i>
the
year previous.</p>

<p>"Next morning I was up bright and early and went aboard the steamer. The
vessel sailed about half-past 9 o'clock, and it was well she started at
that hour, for I learned afterwards, by letter from my father, that as
soon
as Carter missed me, he lost no time in trying to have me brought back
again. A detective was put on my track, who, fortunately for me, arrived
at
the Liverpool docks just a few hours too late."</p>

<p>On September 12, 1881, I received a letter from William Garbett,
president of the Middlesbrough branch, which stated in effect that there

had been a death in his family, another reduction in wages, a poor
harvest
on account of incessant rains, and provisions were rising in price. In
answer, I told him my faith was that he would be emigrated to Utah before

the end of the next year. Circulars were issued by me to his friends,
explaining his situation. The result was sufficient means were procured
to
emigrate Brother Garbett and family (seven in number) to Utah. They
arrived
here in Sept., 1882</p>

<p>Reflecting at various times on the scenes recounted in this little work,
and of the many joyful times experienced among the Saints in
Middlesbrough
and vicinity, it occurred to the writer that a revival of old times and
acquaintanceships would be greatly relished by those who had emigrated
therefrom, and it was finally arranged to have a re-union of the
Middlesbrough branch of the church on Thanksgiving day, November 29,
1883.
</p>

<p>All the Saints and Elders who had been in the branch were invited to be
present at the 4th Ward meeting house, where the re-union was held.
Dinner
was served at 2 p.m., followed by the various exercises, such as singing,

reciting, speaking, etc. The time was agreeably spent till half-past 6
o'clock in the evening. The attendance was numerous without being
crowded,
and the affair was gratifying to all present. It will remain indelibly
impressed upon the memories of all who participated.</p>



<h2><a name="book2">A BOY'S LOVE: A MAN'S DEVOTION</a></h2>



<h2><a name="2chap1">CHAPTER I.</a></h2>

<p class="chapterHeading">WILLIAM ANDERSON'S HEART AND HAND&mdash;HIS EARLY
LIFE, HOME AND SURROUNDINGS.</p>

<p>Two little shreds of yellow paper which would not pass current for the
value of an ordinary letter stamp! And yet they are to be cherished in
the
family Bible as a treasure worthy of loving gaze and reverent touch.</p>

<p>Look at them closer. One resembles a hand and the other a heart. Even in
their freshest and brightest days they would have been condemned by the
artist whose standard is the ideal, and by the anatomist whose sole
appreciation is for the real; for their departure from anatomical truth
is
not in the line of artistic license. Still they are sacred to us.</p>

<p>Why are the papers so yellow? you ask. Because more than half a century
has elapsed since they were cut into these shapes. Why so frayed and
worn?
Because for years they were carried in a woman's bosom. Why so stained?
Because they have been wept over; and doubtless some of the bitterest of

all tears&mdash;the tears which fall from the widowed and the fatherless,

have moistened them. But here is a deeper stain than any which can be
made
by any human tears&mdash;what is it? The blood of an honest man, a
patriot;
the blood which flowed from the real heart of the man whose real hand
clipped these little uncouth models from the old-fashioned sheet and sent

them to his lady-love.</p>

<p>Turn the papers over. What do you read?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"William Anderson sends this hand to his sweetheart, Emeline T. Stewart.
Like myself, it is yours now and forever, if you will it so.</p>

<p class="right">"NEW VINEYARD, MAINE, Christmas, 1829."</p>

<p>"Dear Emeline:</p>

<p>I offer my heart to you. Keep it if you can love me and will be my wife.
</p>

<p>"Your true lover&mdash;and husband, as I hope to be,</p>

<p class="right">WILLIAM ANDERSON."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The writing is cramped, for the hand which laboriously traced so many
words within so small a space, though it belonged to the young
schoolmaster
of the village, was quite as well used to carrying a rifle or wielding an

ax in the forest as to this scholar's work. The composition, too, is
heavy:
William Anderson was not a poet; he was but a plain youth whose best
effort
was to put his honest wish into honest words, and to send his blunt
message
freighted with all his hopes for the future.</p>

<p>Little did he know how his paper hand and heart would be hoarded to come
into the loving care of his descendants! The strong man is dead&mdash;his

mangled clay rests amid the decaying beauties of a city by the banks of
the
lordly Mississippi. The devoted woman is dead&mdash;her tortured body
reposes under mighty Wasatch shadows. But the fragile papers survive; and

the love which brought them into being lives. It lives eternally, if
there
be reward in heaven for sacrifice.</p>

<p>William Anderson was the son of a New Vineyard farmer&mdash;well to do
with the grosser goods of this world, as well as being possessed of
family
pride; and the boy was taught, along with the heavy duties of the field,

something of books. He was indulged, too, in the physical luxury of a
yearly meeting-suit, made out of wondrous fabrics brought all the way
from
Boston, a city more distant and mythical in the estimation of the New
Vineyard people of that day than is Benares to this age.</p>

<p>Large families of children were in the sturdy and healthy New England
fashion of the first quarter of this century, and William's brothers and

sisters numbered near a half score. So the boys were impelled to industry

and self-reliance.</p>

<p>Religious profession of some kind was one of the common comforts of
life; and Mrs. Joy Anderson was proud to marshal "for meetin'" each
Sabbath
a troop as numerous and well-behaved as the family party of Charity
Carver
or Hope Smith. William's mother was of a Puritan family, and vied with
her
female neighbors, whose names indicated the same proud descent, in having

every able member of her household a regular attendant upon divine
service.
</p>

<p>From the country within a radius of five miles of the plain,
old-fashioned, stone meeting house, came, for gossip as much as genuine
worship, all the settlers&mdash;rich and poor, farmers, graziers,
woodsmen
and the few traffickers who were able to make their Yankee shrewdness a
means of maintenance.</p>

<p>One of the principal men of the region comprised in the scattered
village of New Vineyard, was Hugh Stewart, farmer and whilom speculator
in
lands and timber. His family was wont to journey from his residence to
the
church&mdash;a distance of two miles in a carryall.</p>

<p>This vehicle was the object of much reverence; and Hugh managed by
frequent applications of varnish to keep it in that state of glossiness
which constituted its chief awe in New Vineyard eyes. Regularly, rain or

shine, its appearance at the last turn of the sandy road leading to the
meeting-house was announced by some watchful youngster and the waiting
worshipers, who usually assembled an hour in advance of sermon time,
rushed
to the porch to watch the family of the Stewarts dismount from their
carriage. Though this practice was continued for a term of years, it
never
failed to awaken interest. I doubt if the London Lord Mayor's gilded
chariot ever aroused more real excitement among his satiated townsmen
than
was evinced at each appearance of this ancient vehicle at the
meeting-house
steps.</p>

<p>The occupants of the carryall were invariably checked off upon a score
of fingers: "There's Hugh and Martha, and there's Dan'l and Marchant and

Em'line and Car'line."</p>

<p>If one of these usual attendants happened for any reason to be absent,
there were comments and surmises without number until some active
investigator could ascertain the cause; and once learned, the news was
whispered about from lips quivering with eagerness to tell unto ears
twitching with anxiety to hear.</p>

<p>One of the most intensely interested of the watches was Mrs. Joy
Anderson, who felt all that her religion would permit her to entertain of

envy for the almost regal state in which the Stewarts were brought to
church.</p>

<p>More than one scathing rebuke fell from her very capable tongue upon the
well-calloused understanding of William, the senior Anderson. Her stock
complaint is worthy of preservation as showing how little the style of
marital reproach has varied within three-quarters of a century.</p>

<p>"I don't care for myself, and you know I don't; I don't say a grumbling
word at you for not taking me to New York when Mrs. Stewart went with her

husband though you know well enough you were quite as able to pay my way
as
he was to take his wife; and everybody knows that if anyone deserves a
rest
I do; but no, I never can go to visit my cousin Faith Brewster that I
think
the world of, though I've never seen her and only heard from her twice in

my life, and she may have been dead these ten years for all I know or you

care, and even then it would only be my duty to visit her grave and I
could
carry along a little box of mignonette, in case of, to plant on her last

resting place&mdash;no I never say one word about these things, and I
always spare your feelings instead of telling you how often Mrs. Stewart

looks at me as if she had a kind of contemptuous pity for my suffering;
but
what I feel so awfully hurt about are the airs that the Stewart children

put on when they get out of the carriage on Sunday at the meeting-house
door; and we've got more than half the distance to travel and you could
well afford something of the kind, and then we could get to the
meeting-house even if some of us were sick, and because we've had not a
day's sickness in the house in fifteen years is no sign we won't have,
but
all the more sign that it must come sooner or later&mdash;"</p>

<p>Though this some what inconsistent speech was received with no apparent
emotion by the substantial husband and father whom it was intended to
pierce with its sharp sarcasm; it always created a little excitement
among
the children.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stewart was really a good woman who was compelled by frequent
attacks of illness to pay some attention to personal comfort, and who had

never thought of triumphing over her esteemed friend Joy with a glance of

pity. Mrs. Anderson was also a good woman; but she unwittingly taught her

children to hold envy and dislike for neighbors. Probably she was not the

first woman, as she was certainly not the last to pursue this foolish,
unchristianlike course.</p>

<p>Little William was often an attentive listener to this wail of his
mother; and from it he tried to conceive a deep and bitter hatred for the

rival aristocratic family at the other end of the village.</p>

<p>Very strangely, this effort of the boy, begun and religiously pursued
under a sense of family loyalty, was utterly unavailing. There was
something in the soft eyes and patient face of Mrs. Stewart which
consumed
all his bitter thoughts and made him feel more like kissing the lady's
hand
than hating her, even for his injured mother's sake.</p>

<p>Often and often when she was assisting the children from the carriage,
while Hugh&mdash;something too careless in this respect, was taking his
horse from the thills or hailing neighbors in a hearty voice, little Will

Anderson felt a barely resistible inclination to rush forward and offer
his
help. Was he restrained by a fear of punishment from his mother, or the
dread of a refusal from Mrs. Stewart, or anticipation of ridicule from
the
assembled villagers? Not one of these fears influenced him in the least:
he
was simply afraid that there was one of the children that he could not
lift. It was not tall Dan, nor fat March; for he felt that he could toss

them both over the meeting house if such conduct would have been
advantageous to the Stewart family; though either of the boys was as
large
as two such chaps as Will. And of course it was not little Carrie, for
she
was only a baby, three years old, "lighter than goose down," as Will
thought, but did not say aloud. But it was Emeline.</p>

<p>Will had looked this girl in the face, from a distance, two or three
times&mdash;she had brown eyes, deep and true; and brown hair, in heavy,

rich coils. Her face was as full of unsullied beauty as a lily blossom.
It
had always a thoughtful expression as if the little brain were solving
some
grave problem of more than human interest. At least, all this is what
Will
saw and felt in an indistinct sort of fashion. I doubt if she were quite
so
ethereally beautiful as Will imagined; for girls born and reared on New
England farms are not as fragile as a hot-house flower, and I dare say
that
she laughed as often as other girls; I know from personal knowledge that
in
later life she was not too prim to play practical jokes.</p>

<p>But Will felt that he could not, for his very life, offer to lift this
girl from the carriage step. He was stout and heavy twelve years old; and

Emeline was light and slender nine; yet the exertion, especially if she
should happen to look at him from her wonderful eyes, would be fatal.</p>





<h2><a name="2chap2">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="chapterHeading">BOYHOOD SPORTS&mdash;AN AMATEUR MILITIA&mdash;A
CAMPAIGN INCIDENT&mdash;WILL ANDERSON'S GALLANTRY&mdash;CHRISTMAS MORNING

GREETING&mdash;THE AFTERNOON SERVICE&mdash;A COMBAT AMONG THE BOYS.</p>

<p>Will was more than five years old when peace was declared after the
second war with Great Britain; and the subject, in that time of
slow-moving
news, was still a matter for frequent talk when he completed his tenth
year. He was then admitted into the ranks of the "Continental Veterans,"
an
organization of the patriotic youths who trained along the roads and in
the
woods adjoining the village, and told to each other, with passionate
interest, all the tales of adventure and heroism which they could glean
from their elders. The youngsters kept up really an accurate show of a
military organization; including this important feature (which they had
learned from the example of their elders), that all were officers of some

rank or other. In the day-time they built fires in the woods on the banks

of the Penobscot; and pretended that they were surrounded by night, dark
as
a stack of black cats. Occasionally they captured a calf and tried it as
a
spy by court-martial; usually allowing it to escape, at the last moment,

its sentence of hanging, and then putting the guards on trial for aiding
in
the escape.</p>

<p>Four years of this training made Will a major, all the elder boys
ranking from lieutenant colonel upward.</p>

<p>One afternoon late in the Autumn, when they were having a jolly good
time in ambush along the old south road, a picket sentry announced a body

of the enemy advancing rapidly. The hostile party consisted of one little

girl, Emeline Stewart, who was trotting briskly homeward from her weekly

visit to the village sewing school. Will was scouting at another point in

company with Emeline's two brothers; and when one of the colonels
suggested
taking the entire force of the enemy prisoner of war, no dissenting voice

was raised.</p>

<p>They met and seized her, poor, timid, little Emeline! She knew these
boys, her school-fellows and playmates, and they were not rough; but they

kept up such a style of martial bravado, and talked so glibly of
court-martial and execution&mdash;they rehearsed with such sanguinary
details the precedents established last week by the hanging of eight
Hessian and Tory spies, that the child was struck speechless with fear.
</p>

<p>From long practice, the young rogues acted with as much confidence and
presence of mind as if they had been really old soldiers. What alarmed
Emeline most of all was that they never once lapsed back from soldiers
into
the village boys of her acquaintance. Look at them with pleading eyes as

much as she would, they gave no response. Without knowing how they were
startling the child, the boys kept on with their cruel work.</p>

<p>A council of war was called, with General Hezekiah Bradford presiding;
and before this pompous assemblage Emeline was commanded to stand and
plead. She burst into tears and then sank down upon the mossy sward,
while
the boys, struck with sudden remorse, gazed blankly at her and then at
each
other.</p>

<p>At this instant Will and his companions hurried into the camp. A few
words of explanation from one of Will's brothers revealed the whole
situation, including the identity of "the enemy."</p>

<p>While they were gazing at the child's recumbent form, Hezzy Bradford
spoke:</p>

<p>"Guards, remove the prisoner, and"&mdash;</p>

<p>He was about to conclude with "set her at liberty;" but Will did not
wait to hear the conclusion. Deeming this speech but a continuation of
the
cruelty shown toward Emeline, he rushed at the president of the
court-martial and with one accidentally-directed bunt, he knocked that
august official from his seat of pine boughs and sprawled him upon his
back, breathless and helpless for the moment.</p>

<p>Without waiting for any consultation or help, Will picked up the slender
child and darted away with her; while the Continental Veterans, including

Emeline's brothers, stood gaping as if they had lost their senses.</p>

<p>Once out upon the road and far enough from the camp to show that
immediate pursuit was not intended. Will was fain to place Emeline upon a

bank, that they both might get breath.</p>

<p>The child looked at him with wonder, at first mingled with fear. But
soon she realized that he was her rescuer and began to thank him in her
tender, cooing way; soon changing to a just and fiery indignation at her

tormentors.</p>

<p>Will's physical exertion had been a trifle compared with the
overwhelming nature of Emeline's glance. He was now ready to wilt. He
might
have fled ignominiously, but just at that moment when he felt himself
about
to take this course a shout came from the boys in the wood.</p>

<p>Will at once squared himself sturdily, intending to encounter all
comers. But Emeline, with a cry of affright, sprang to her feet and
cried:
</p>

<p>"Oh, quick, Will! Let us run for home or those wicked boys will catch me
again!"</p>

<p>At this familiar invitation, the boy took the outstretched hand of the
child into his own broader palm; and thus together they ran toward the
Stewart residence, Will giving the little girl a helpful lift at every
step
of the flight.</p>

<p>Looking back as they ran, Will saw his comrades emerge from the wood and
shake their warrior fists at the fugitives; but he readily observed that
a
hopeful pursuit was deemed out of the question, and that the boys were
not
intending to chase.</p>

<p>The gate opening into the Stewart grounds was speedily reached and then
Will stopped and expected Emeline to enter. But she remained outside long

enough to say:</p>

<p>"Will Anderson, you are better than a brother to me. If you had not been
there, so good and brave, what could I have done!"</p>

<p>When the grateful child at last disappeared within the house, Will
turned to walk slowly back to the village.</p>

<p>He traversed the first mile on his return journey with no disturbance to
his happy reflection; and then he entered the turn of the road leading
through the wood. Raising his eyes at some slight sound in front, he saw
a
phalanx of the Continental Veterans drawn up in line across his path;
while
at the same moment a similar body of troops closed in from the sides and

took position a few steps in the rear of his person. Will was taken in an

ambuscade, which was performed so successfully and with such perfect
regard
to military precedent, that it is probably talked of to this day in New
Vineyard among the great grandchildren of the Continental Veterans.</p>

<p>A colonel solemnly placed Will under arrest; and then, by command of
General Bradford, the troop marched to the encampment in the depths of
the
pine wood.</p>

<p>The court-martial so abruptly dismissed an hour before was now
ceremoniously re-convened, and William Anderson, major in the Continental

Veterans, was charged with an attack upon his superior officer. The
accusation was proved and the sentence of the court, General Bradford
still
sitting as presiding officer, was that the culprit be dismissed the
service.
</p>

<p>As the sentence was being pronounced, Will sprang to his feet and
shouted:</p>

<p>"Boys, don't carry this further. I believe in military discipline, but
let us settle this matter outside of the army.</p>

<p>"Hezzy, if I hit you, I did it accidentally; but I'm ready to take the
consequences, and I'll stand up and fight you until you get satisfaction.

Come on, you're bigger than I am and you're three years older; you're
sure
to get the best of it. Let's fight it out between us two and let that
settle the matter."</p>

<p>Such a plan did not entirely suit the general. He remarked:</p>

<p>"You're sentenced; and you'll have to quit the service. But I'll give
you plenty of `consequences' besides, so make ready."</p>

<p>This truthful historian grieves to say that in the fight which ensued,
General Bradford disgraced his uniform by cowardice; that most of the
boys
were afraid to interfere even when they saw the plainest rules of combat

violated by the strapping Hezekiah; and lastly, that the hero of this
sketch was whaled in a most sanguinary fashion.</p>

<p>To Will's credit be it said that he fought with all the energy of his
being, administering occasional terrific blows on the rosy nose of the
general; and that he made no cry for quarter even when soundly thrashed.
</p>

<p>After the encounter, the boys dispersed to their homes.</p>

<p>Will's heart was full of grief&mdash;not so much for the licking as for
his dismissal from the ranks of the Continental Veterans. But he tried to

bear up bravely in the hope that Emeline's kind feeling for him was
permanent and not dependent upon his military position.</p>

<p>The Stewart boys went home with some shame in their minds for the
unsoldier-like part which they had played in the thrilling events of the

afternoon. But they sought to make amends by describing Will's chivalry
and
pluck in most extravagant terms to Emeline and all the other younger
members of the household.</p>

<p>Emeline was deeply interested in the recital; and her soft little heart
was torn between reverence for Will's heroism and indignation at the
baseness of his persecutors&mdash;even her own brothers coming in for a
lecture which made them hang their heads and look at each other in a most

woe-begone fashion.</p>

<p>During the next few days Will had much to suffer; for big boys who were
high officers in the Vets. laughed at him, and little boys, whose highest

temporary aspiration was to belong to that corps, sneered and chuckled
whenever they caught sight of this dismounted "knight of the sorrowful
visage."</p>

<p>Seven weeks passed before Christmas morning dawned in that bitterly cold
Winter of 1823. With the rising of the sun that day, two boys drawing a
sled on which was seated a little girl, well wrapped and cuddled,
appeared
at the door of the Anderson residence&mdash;the girl was Emeline and the

boys were Dan and March, whom she had forced into reluctant service. They

entered the big kitchen, upon the invitation of Mrs. Joy, and amid a
chorus
of salutations in which the visitors bore their part.</p>

<p>When they were fairly in the house, with the biting frost shut out and
the tumult ended, Emeline asked for Will.</p>

<p>It is very unromantic but it is truth that the object of her inquiry was
at that particular moment seated at one corner of the fireplace,
straining
himself black in the face to draw on a pair of damp cowhide boots over a

pair of similarly damp woolen socks&mdash;all of which personal
belongings
he had been seeking to dry by the morning fire, when this astounding
interruption came.</p>

<p>Will succeeded in getting both boots on "as far as the heels," but go no
further they would; and when his father called him to come forward, the
poor boy got up and walked in agony and distortion toward Emeline. He was

at least three inches taller than common, from the fact that his chubby
heels rested upon the high, implacable stiffening of the boots; and his
face wore a twisted look of agony which, coupled with his abnormal
height,
would have made him unrecognizable by casual acquaintances.</p>

<p>Most of the family laughed, and Dan and March joined in the hilarity
&mdash;for really Will did appear grotesque; but Emeline either from
absolute unconsciousness or gentle cunning, did not seem to notice the
boy's awkward situation, and she began to take to him with a
self-possession entirely unruffled.</p>

<p>"Will," she said, "I have brought you a pair of mittens for a Christmas
gift. They're my first knitting and mother says they're not good enough
for
a present; but they're the best I can do now, and I offer them to you
because you've been so kind to me and had to suffer so much for my sake.
I
hope you will wear them, will you?"</p>

<p>Emeline had ample time for this long speech. Poor Will was dumb and
gulping. But before it was ended his confusion had shrunk his feet so
that
he was able to literally sink into his boots, and with this relief his
face
had changed from a purple hue to a good tint of health. He found his
voice
in time to answer:</p>

<p>"That I will, if mother will let me&mdash;that is, I mean if your mother
will let me."</p>

<p>And so the blushing boy stretched out his hand and took the package, but
Emeline kept a tight hold of one end of the cloth in which the mittens
were
wrapped, as she was under positive instructions from her thrifty mother
to
return the piece of hickory, for which the shoulder of Dan's second-best

shirt was even then yawning.</p>

<p>The separation of the gift from its wrappings was soon achieved, and the
hickory tucked into the depth of Emeline's pocket. Then wholesome maple
sugar was produced, and with it a few pieces of sugar candy such as some
of
those young lips had never before had an opportunity to smack over.
During
the hilarity which ensued, Will was doing his best to creep back into a
state of self-possession. But this work was prodigious and slow; for when

he had several times fairly arrived at a stage of comparative comfort, a

friendly glance from the kind little knitter sent him again into a state
of
confusion. After the Christmas luxuries had been distributed and given
lodgment in capacious stomachs or economizing pockets, the Stewart
children
departed and left Will to the ungentle raillery of his family. Being
amply
able to care for himself in a family contest with either ridicule or
logic
as the weapon&mdash;or, what is sometimes as good as both, a downright
unreasoning self-assertiveness, Will felt no pain during the assault to
which he was subjected; rather, he derived keen enjoyment from it.</p>

<p>In the afternoon sacred services were held in the meeting house; for
these people gave to every observance, which they deemed holy, their
highest esteem, and nearly all the inhabitants of the village were
present.
Probably the good old preacher who was a new comer to the village, had
delivered forty other Christmas sermons, or even the same sermon forty
other times; but familiarity with the subject had not lessened his
power.
</p>

<p>He first stilled the buzz of gossiping whisper when he announced that
his text would be form one of the great poets; and the congregation bent

with horror to hear what dreadful thing he next would utter. Even into
this
remote corner of the New World had penetrated the evil fame of the
irreverent poet lord, "Childe Harold," and even the very name of poet
brought with it an oppressive sense of sin.</p>

<p>The false impression was soon removed. In a voice rendered tremulous by
age and feeling, the minister repeated some of the verses of Milton&mdash;

the Christian whose earthly sight had been lost at last to make his
Heavenly vision more complete. As the wonderful words of adoration filled

the house of worship, every head was bowed in contrition for unworthy
thought:</p>

<blockquote><p>
"This is the month and this the happy morn,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherein the Son of Heaven's eternal King,<br>
Of wedded maid and virgin mother born,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our great redemption from above did bring;<br>
For so the holy sages once did sing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he our deadly forfeit should release,<br>
And with his Father work us a perpetual peace.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Having won his congregation to solemnity of feeling, the preacher taught
them that "All good Christians celebrate the day of Christ's nativity, a

day of joy both in heaven and on earth: in heaven for a day of glory unto

God on high; on earth for a day of peace here below, and good-will
towards
men; a day of joy to all people past, present and to come; such a day as

wherein, after long expectation, the best return was made that ever came
to
the poor sons of men; such a day as the Lord Himself made. Let us
therefore
rejoice therein!"</p>

<p>Even impatient and restless youth was awed by the manner and words of
the earnest minister; and the boys restrained within unusual bounds their

desire to be out of church amidst the hearty enjoyments of the day.</p>

<p>When the service was ended, the people dispersed more slowly and
thoughtfully than was their wont; but humanity cannot long be kept upon
such an exalted plane of feeling, and soon began the gossip and
familiarity
common to the occasion. Especially among the young people was the
reaction
quickly noticeable; and while the elders were speaking of the latest
birth,
death and marriage, the children were already beginning to romp even at
the
very door of the meeting-house. The youngsters, despite their exceptional

appreciation of the sermon, and even more as a wilful revulsion from
their
noteworthy behavior, were determined now to compensate themselves for
self-sacrifice; and they gathered in a noisy crowd in the street passing

before the house of worship.</p>

<p>The sun was sending down his best Winter beams, and the snow was made
just moist enough for sport; so a contest of snow-balling was at once
informally arranged between the boys. Hezzy Bradford was one of the
leaders, and when he and his rival had each made choice of two or three
of
the larger boys, someone already chosen said to Hezzy:</p>

<p>"Take Will Anderson&mdash;there he comes. He's the straightest thrower
of the lot."</p>

<p>But Hezzy, whose dislike of Will had been steadily augmenting since the
fight in the pine grove, was not ready to make peace with his victim. So
he
shook his head and sneeringly cried:</p>

<p>"Here comes the baby who wears mittens to a snow-balling match, for fear
that his fingers will get wet. Watch me tip his cap off!"</p>

<p>With these words Hezzy threw an icy snow-ball which he had been
carelessly making while choosing sides. The missile flew straight to its

mark, and Will felt his head stung sharply as his cap tumbled into the
road.
</p>

<p>Will saw the hand of Hezzy and knew that retaliation meant a renewal of
hostilities; but he did not hesitate. He pulled off his valued mittens,
crowded them into his pockets and in a moment proved that any praise of
his
accurate throwing was not ill bestowed. He cast a snow-ball fairly into
Hezzy's ear, rather staggering that blusterer, and causing a peal of
laughter to go up from the crowd.</p>

<p>As our boy had expected, Hezzy declared war and rushed forward to
summarily punish this reckless antagonist.</p>

<p>Was it that the insult to the mittens had nerved Will with a superhuman
strength? or was it that all the indignation of weeks became suddenly
centered in his arm? Whatever may have been the reason, he fought with an

effective vigor, before which Master Hezekiah Bradford, general, village

bully and aspiring sweetheart was compelled to go ingloriously down.
Briefly and plainly told, Will, to his own astonishment, no less than to

the marvel of the spectators, licked Hezzy until that great military
commander was glad to cry for quarter and surrender unconditionally.</p>

<p>More than one oppressed youngster was gladdened by the result of this
combat; and so great was the excitement, produced that the general
contest
was incontinently forsaken.</p>

<p>Hezzy was led away by his brothers and one or two others, who gave him a
kind of contemptuous attention; but the majority of the boys crowded near

to the conqueror.</p>

<p>From this hour, Will's rank among his companions was undisputed. He had
soundly thrashed the commander-in-chief of the Continental Vets.; and
without any request from himself, he was speedily restored to his former

rank of major, only to relinquish that position very soon to be installed

in the chief place vacated, in profound disgust, by Hezekiah Bradford.</p>



<p>Nor was this the least of his triumphs. When next he met Mrs. Stewart
she praised his powers in unstinted terms. Though the conscientious lady

could not exactly approve of fighting among boys, nevertheless she felt
that Will's troubles and subsequent victories were traceable directly to

his manly defense of her daughter; and Mrs. Stewart could not withhold
her
congratulations. And Emeline, herself, from out her brown eyes looked
such
pleasure at him during the next school session that he felt almost
self-reproachful at receiving so much reward.</p>



<h2><a name="2chap3">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="chapterHeading">THE PROGRESS OF THE AGE&mdash;WILL ANDERSON'S
COURTSHIP&mdash;THE CHRISTMAS SERMON.</p>

<p>In those times the months moved on in serene procession with the people
of New Vineyard. In a later age of rapidly-recurring marvels we are wont
to
speak of the first quarter of this century as a "slow-poke, old-fogy
time;"
we contemptuously wonder how men endured the tedious drag of the
seasons.
</p>

<p>In William Anderson's journal I find a note which gives token of the
dawn of this great modern day of progress. He writes:</p>

<p>"<i>August 2</i>, 1824.&mdash;Not many days ago, Mr. Stewart gave me a
newspaper to read; he said something was in it which ought to interest a

bright boy like myself. (I only repeat this because Emeline's father said

it.) The paper is the <i>Hancock Gazette and Penobscot Patriot</i>, of
May
26, 1824; and it tells of a wonderful ship which has come into the lower

waters of our river. It works with fire instead of wind and it can walk
against tide, or current, or gale, as well as a horse can trot against a

breeze. I have heard before of this marvelous thing called a steamship,
but
never thought it was a true wonder; but if it is really traveling up
against a heavy Penobscot current, fire or steam or something else that
is
unusual must move it, for I am sure that no landward breeze that ever
came
off the Atlantic could do such a work. At any rate, I must see this
strange
ship and decide whether I shall believe or not."</p>

<p>The biographer finds that Providence favored Will with a trip to Bangor
later in the year. How he came to be thus blessed the excited youth does

not relate&mdash;beyond the fact that he went with his father, who
adventured so far from home as a factor of the log men of the upper
Penobscot to deal with the opulent lumber-mill owners at Bangor. Much
that
ensued upon this important journey is lost to us, through Will's hurried

state after his return. But we learn that the steamship was actually a
fact; for Will stepped on board the <i>Maine</i>, a boat of one hundred
tons burthen, commanded by Captain Porter&mdash;the first steamer and the

first steamer captain to be in Penobscot waters. And it is also proven
that
the wondrous vessel could move without the aid of sails; for after Will
had
disembarked he saw her shift her moorings a quarter of a mile directly
against wind and current.</p>

<p>What most fills the journal at this period is that Will was scratching
an aching and unresponsive head, seeking to decide upon some suitable
present for Emeline which could be compassed by the contents of his
little
bead purse. After much anxiety he felt a sudden thrill of satisfaction as

he remembered the poet whose sublime words the old preacher had quoted
last
Christmas day. He found, after much search, a shoe shop where books were

also kept (for in those days business was not so scrupulously and
appropriately divided as now). But, alas! the only copy of Milton was
priced at twenty-seven shillings, while his purse held scarcely half that

much!</p>

<p>He turned away in utter disappointment, when the thought came to him:
</p>

<p>"Why do I seek the modern poet who sang of Jesus? The book which tells
all we know of Him, I am sure is easier got."</p>

<p>He retraced his steps, and upon the cobbler-bookseller's shelves he
found a red morocco-bound Testament, which was offered at thirteen
shillings; and this he bought and later reverently packed away among the

wonderful supplies which had been purchased by the elder William under
distant direction of the precise and thrifty Mrs. Joy.</p>

<p>It was bleak November when the two Williams Anderson returned to New
Vineyard. What holiday secrets they had in store they kept well; and the

Christmas Day brought many surprises.</p>

<p>To Emeline&mdash;found upon the Stewart mansion door-steps that sacred
morning&mdash;came a little package which, unwrapped, showed a Testament

bound in red morocco. That precious little book is now before the eyes of

this historian. Upon its yellow-stained title page are discernible these

words:</p>

<p>"My friend, EMELINE T. STEWART,</p>

<p>"You will please accept this Testament as a gift from</p>

<p>"Your Friend,</p>

<p>"WILLIAM ANDERSON.</p>

<p>"EMELINE:&mdash;Ask, and ye shall receive. Knock, and it shall be opened
unto you."</p>

<p>Four years slipped away. During this time Will was bashfully loving
Emeline; and Emeline, well, she was bashfully watching Will's love.</p>

<p>This wondrous flower of affection grows by "bashful watching" just as
morning glories unfold in greeting to the hour of enchantment. And when
the
Christmas Day of 1828 came, each of these dear children went to church
and
watched the other.</p>

<p>The sermon was, for Christmas, a novel one, both in text and treatment.
It related to marriage as a state ordained for man; and the text was from

Fuller's "Holy State," wherein it is declared:</p>

<p>"It is the policy of the Londoners, when they send a ship into the
Levant or Mediterranean Sea, to make every mariner therein a merchant,
each
seaman adventuring somewhat of his own, which will make him more wary to

avoid, and more valiant to encounter dangers. Thus married men,
especially
if having posterity, are the deeper shares in the state wherein they
live,
which engageth their affections to the greater loyalty. And though
bachelors be the strongest stakes, yet married men are the best binders
in
the hedge of the commonwealth."</p>

<p>Will's mind must have been holding a thought not utterly foreign to the
text; for he unconsciously nodded approval of the very sensible
sentiment;
and then he glanced at Emeline. The same instant, her eyes were lifted
from
a strained look at the floor and were turned in his direction. One long

gaze passed between them; and this was Will's informal proposition of
marriage and Emeline's informal acceptance.</p>



<h2><a name="2chap4">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="chapterHeading">WILLIAM ANDERSON'S MARRIAGE AND JOURNEY WESTWARD
&mdash;HE AND HIS WIFE HEAR THE GOSPEL&mdash;VISIT NAUVOO&mdash;GATHER
WITH
THE SAINTS&mdash;THE BATTLE OF NAUVOO.</p>

<p>It was five hours less than one year later in the serene chronology of
New Vineyard, when Will sent his paper heart and hand to Emeline. His
trusty younger brother, Barton, was his messenger; and to escape
observation, the boy was compelled to go early and return quickly. At
breakfast, Will saw Barton enter the house and one glance told that the
mission had been successfully performed.</p>

<p>Some hours later, at the regular Christmas services in the
meeting-house, Will saw Emeline. His look was an anxious question, and
hers
was a gentle affirmative answer; and this was Will's formal proposition
of
marriage and Emeline's formal acceptance.</p>

<p>William Anderson and Emeline T. Stewart were wedded in their little town
of New Vineyard, September 6, 1831.</p>

<p>Is this too abrupt? It might be if marriage were the end of the story;
but unlike fiction, in real life the most uneventful period of human
existence is from engagement to marriage; and unlike fiction, in real
life
the importance of existence comes after marriage.</p>

<p>Not long did they remain in their little village home. For William had
decided to seek a greater measure of prosperity in the wide lands lying
far
beyond New Vineyard in the mysterious West.</p>

<p>Happy indeed was the fortune which carried them away from Maine. Their
long journey across half a continent was a revelation of Divinity to
their
souls. Mountain, forest, lake, cataract, valley&mdash;breathed with
beauty
and grandeur. Two ardent beings, viewing all things under the radiance of

their mutual love, saw the majesty of the land, the water and the arching

cloud space above, with reverent eyes&mdash;for beyond these tangible
evidences of sublime power, they sensed the Eternal Cause.</p>

<p>It was in the days and weeks of lonely journeying that they learned how
to pray; they felt that never again would supplication and song of praise

to Almighty God be formal lip-service given only at stated intervals
&mdash;
rather it would be an hourly and often silent communion with the Creator.

In the day, they felt the Holy Presence in every glory which adorned the

earth; at night, in the quiet of the woods, they gazed through swaying
tree-tops, and saw the stars shedding earthward a serene beauty: and they

knew that the God who, from His far-off seat of power, could unfold the
swamp-pink flowers by the side of their lonely path, and could send
through
unfathomed space the light of countless spheres to cheer the silent
watches
of the night&mdash;could also lend His special care to the sentient
worshiping creatures of His love.</p>

<p>Far away upon the prairie they at last decided to make their home. They
settled in Bureau County, Illinois; and William became a sturdy western
farmer. In the ten years following their marriage three children came to

make their domestic happiness complete. The eldest was a son, Augustus;
the
others were daughters, Caroline and Martha.</p>

<p>Each season of the year brought its allotted toil, and the reward of
perseverance and thrift was earthly prosperity.</p>

<p>Occasionally they heard rumors of a strange sect of religious believers,
with a prophet, who dwelt in a wonderful city on the banks of the
Mississippi, far to the south-west of their home. And one Summer day in
1841, four strange men, plain but pleasing in appearance, stopped at
their
door. These men were missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ,
journeying
from the city of Nauvoo to proclaim His words to the honest-in-heart
throughout the land. They left their marvelous message with William and
Emeline, with the admonition to pray to God who would reveal whether the

doctrine was true or false; and one of them in leaving prophesied in
these
words:</p>

<p>"You will yet see the time when you will regret having let this hour
pass unheeded&mdash;this hour wherein you have the opportunity to accept,

through baptism, the gospel of our Lord."</p>

<p>The prophecy was fulfilled. Before many days had elapsed the truth was
plain to the minds of William and Emeline; and they awaited anxiously the

visit of an Elder who might give them membership in the Church of their
Savior. When weeks passed without the appearance of missionaries William

regretted his obduracy at the time when he was first pressed to accept
the
truth.</p>

<p>Later, another opportunity came, and on the 15th day of August of that
year, 1841, in the waters of Bureau Creek, William was immersed in sacred

baptism. Afterward, Emeline rendered similar reverence to the requirement

of the gospel.</p>

<p>As soon as he could garner his crops, William felt that he must hasten
to the beautiful city of the Father of Waters. He carried with him on the

eventful journey to Nauvoo his wife and their three little ones; and they

reached the city on Thursday, September 30th, 1841.</p>

<p>On the day following, the great conference of the Church was to have
opened; but the storm prevented the assembling of the Saints. And after
learning that the meetings were postponed for one day, William left his
wife and children comfortably shielded in their wagon from the blast
while
he wandered about regardless of the storm. He looked with awestruck
vision
upon the temple which was rearing its majestic presence toward heaven;
and
he gazed with curiosity at the place which was being excavated for the
foundation of the Nauvoo House.</p>

<p>The next day, Saturday, October 2nd, the people crowded to the meeting
ground and organized themselves into their quorums in order. The corner
stone of the Nauvoo House was laid that morning; but in the afternoon
services in the conference meeting were held.</p>

<p>The Sabbath came&mdash;a bleak day; but William and Emeline, with their
little ones, were at the meeting grounds, and they saw and heard that day

the Prophet of God.</p>

<p>The very sight of Joseph, graceful, erect, commanding; with flashing
eyes and animated gesture, was enough to thrill these humble believers
with
joy. But when they heard his voice, with its wonderful impressive
sweetness, they shed tears of happiness.</p>

<p>Joseph's sermon was upon the glorious principle of redemption for the
dead; and he portrayed the greatness of Divine compassion and benevolence

in this plan of human salvation. He said:</p>

<p>"View two brothers&mdash;equally intelligent, learned, virtuous and
lovely&mdash;walking in uprightness and all good conscience, so far as
they
are able to discern duty from the muddy stream of tradition or from the
blotted page of the book of nature. One dies and is buried, never having

heard the gospel of reconciliation. To the other the message of salvation

is sent; he hears and embraces it and is made the heir of eternal life.
</p>

<p>"Shall the one become the partaker of glory and the other be consigned
to hopeless perdition? Is there no chance for his escape? Sectarianism
answers, `None, none!' Such an idea is worse than atheism. The truth
shall
break down and dash in pieces all such bigoted Pharisaism. The sects
shall
be sifted, the honest-in-heart brought out and the priests left in the
midst of their corruption."</p>

<p>Such was the new and exalted nature of the instruction; and when the
conference was ended William and Emeline had determined to sacrifice
their
distant possessions and gather with the Saints in the beautiful city. But

their desire was not immediately fulfilled; for William was called to
preach and discuss through the States; and in his absence Emeline nobly
and
cheerfully toiled for her children and their dear father.</p>

<p>Nearly three years of missionary labor, broken by intervals of farm
toil, had passed when, on the darkest day of the darkest June ever seen
by
the summers of this great land, a treasonable massacre took place at the

little stone jail in Carthage. The appalling news of this great national

crime reached out with sudden horror to all the abiding places of the
scattered Saints.</p>

<p>William heard the dread story and hastened home. His property was fairly
given away, and soon he was with his encompassed and persecuted brethren
in
Nauvoo.</p>

<p>Immediately he was enrolled in the Legion; later he was appointed
sergeant; and still later, captain.</p>

<p>I have here the original certificate of his rank as sergeant. The paper
is old and the ink is faded; but every letter is legible. It reads:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="right">"May 12th, 1845.</p>

<p>"GREETING:</p>

<p>"This is to certify that William Anderson is appointed first sergeant in
the second company, fifth regiment, second cohort of the Nauvoo Legion.
And
he is therefore to obey all orders and commands of his superior officers

with fidelity according to law and military rule and discipline.</p>

<p>"Given under my hand May 12th, 1845.</p>

<p class="right">"ISAAC ALLRED, Capt."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>William Anderson and Emeline were faithful; and they received the
blessings of the temple. And on "Tuesday of the first week in February,
1846, I [William Anderson] received in marriage in God's Holy House,
Drusilla Sargent."</p>

<p>In all the tragic history of the ensuing two years, William was a
staunch actor. It was a piteous time! History shows no greater brutality

than that which was perpetrated against the city and the Saints, by
officially protected mobs; and in the trying days every man was compelled

to show his mettle. William Anderson's journal is filled with the record
of
this awful period. Its simple, unaffected words show how closely allied
were the people of Nauvoo to the sublime martyrs of other centuries.</p>

<p>The history of that brief time should be read by every youth in Utah.
</p>

<p>On the 10th day of September, 1846&mdash;after the cruelly-enforced
migration of many of the people of Nauvoo&mdash;there were left to guard

the city and its remaining population of women and babes, sick and
tottering old men&mdash;only 123 citizens who were capable to bear arms.
</p>

<p>And this was the hour selected by the fiends incarnate for their descent
upon Nauvoo. The city was surrounded by an efficiently-armed mob, nearly

2,000 strong; and a bombardment was begun by the besiegers.</p>

<p>When the thunder of the mob's traitorous guns shook the air of Nauvoo,
William sprang up to answer the call of duty.</p>

<p>Emeline and Drusilla clung to him&mdash;a fearful foreboding of personal
evil seemed to take sound and volume with every reverberation of the
artillery discharges. But he was firm. He pressed his fond and faithful
wives&mdash;his helpmeets given him of God&mdash;to his martial bosom;
and
then he left them to solace themselves by prayer while he rushed to the
encounter.</p>

<p>Then these two good women&mdash;sisters, nay dearer to each other than
sisters&mdash;knelt down, with arms clasped about each others waists and

prayed to the All-Merciful to bring their good husband home in safety
from
the battle.</p>

<p>One day, two days passed. It was the morning of the 12th day of
September, 1846. William was bidding farewell to his wives and his
children; when Emeline sobbed anew:</p>

<p>"Oh, my beloved! Let not Augustus go to the battle today. He is but a
child: think, William! he is only fourteen. Each day he has followed you,

taking his gun on his shoulder to fight the wicked enemy and to brave a
dreadful death. Let him stay with me!"</p>

<p>Even as she spoke, the thunder of the cannonade shook the city; and
William sprang away to hasten to his post, while Augustus gave a ringing

cry and fled from the house.</p>

<p>The two women and the little girls were left alone&mdash;Emeline and her
younger sister wife, the loving Drusilla, and Caroline and Martha&mdash;
white and trembling.</p>

<p>Hours elapsed, during which these good women were praying as they toiled.
</p>

<p>The sounds of the battle waging around the city neither distracted them
from devotion nor domestic duty.</p>

<p>Gradually there came a lull; and a momentary hope sprang up in their
hearts. But even while the precious thought was taking form, a rattle of

musketry shook the window panes; and a moment later the deep boom of a
siege gun&mdash;shaking the houses from chimney to cellar&mdash;told that

the struggle was renewed in all its fierceness.</p>

<p>When this grim messenger dispelled their hope with his harsh voice,
Emeline pressed her hands to her bosom and sank upon the floor. As she
dropped she cried:</p>

<p>"Drusilla, my friend, this instant has widowed us and has taken from
this house its only son. I feel the dread fact her in my heart!"</p>

<p>The younger wife and the two little girls hastened to the side of
Emeline, and there they knelt, weeping and moaning. The premonition
seemed
too real to be disputed.</p>

<p>While the women and children were rocking back and forth in their agony
of apprehension, a hurried knock was heard at the door; and, without
waiting for a response, a brother soldier of William stalked into the
room.
He saw the piteous sight; and all his gallant hardihood gave way.
Mingling
his heavy tears with the rain from gentler eyes, he sobbed:</p>

<p>"My sister, our Savior help you! Brother Anderson is dead! God's will be
done!"</p>

<p>The spirit of courage sustained Emeline, and she cried:</p>

<p>"Where is our husband? Alive he was ours&mdash;and we will have his clay
now life is ended. Call my boy to bring his father's body home. God's
will
be done!"</p>

<p>While the grief-shaken soldier was replying, another breathless
messenger burst in, saying between his gasps of haste and sorrow:</p>

<p>"Your boy is dead! Oh, Sister Anderson, he fell a martyr&mdash;brave,
manly, beyond his years&mdash;he took a soldier's part: he has met a
soldier's fate."</p>

<p>Did this last blow send Emeline swooning? No: in such a crisis a noble,
religious soul is exalted beyond the reach of earthly mourning.</p>

<p>Calmly she spoke:</p>

<p>"I will go forth and find our dead&mdash;my murdered boy and our
martyred husband&mdash;Drusilla. Do you prepare couches for their
home-coming."</p>

<p>But Drusilla was herself a heroine:</p>

<p>"No, my sister," she said, "your duty is at home. Often your life has
been threatened by this mob. They will watch our husband's body, and if
you
appear you too will be sacrificed. I am not known as Captain Anderson's
wife. I will go out and secure the bodies of our dear ones, while you
shall
remain with these fatherless babes of yours&mdash;of ours."</p>

<p>Drusilla rushed from the house as she spoke. Emeline would have
followed; but one of her husband's comrades had remained to restrain her,

and besides, her little daughters clung at her skirts, determined to
prevent her going forth.</p>

<p>So Emeline stayed at the stricken house, preparing for that last solemn
home-coming of her soldier spouse and son. While she toiled to fit a bed

for the dear forms&mdash;now stilled through earthly time&mdash;she
recalled from her memory that the anniversary of her wedding day was but

six days past; and in another fortnight she would be 34 years old&mdash;
already, in her early prime, she was the widow of a martyr and the mother

of a murdered patriot.</p>

<p>Drusilla went abroad through the smoky streets of Nauvoo, escorted by
one of the heroic defenders, to the east side of the city. There, resting

where he had fallen against a wall, was the bleeding body of her husband.

Bravely this fair young woman took from her own shoulders a cloak and
laid
it across the mangled form.</p>

<p>She breathed a prayer, beseeching strength and courage; and then she
sought the place where lay Augustus, the slain son. Tenderly, as if he
had
been her own boy or brother, she spread her apron over his face.</p>

<p>Then she followed the procession which escorted the bodies of these
martyrs to their home.</p>

<p>Who shall speak the agony of the ensuing hours! Two bodies, beloved in
life, beloved still in death, were resting in that stricken house. While

Emeline and Drusilla, and the little daughters, all robbed of their
defenders, wept and moaned in a torture such as seldom comes to
womankind.
</p>

<p>As she sobbed and prayed, Emeline took from the bosom of her husband a
tiny, blood-stained packet. It contained a little flower of hair,
Drusilla's, her own and Will's; and also those slips of paper&mdash;the
hand and heart. The morning when Will first went out to battle, she and
Drusilla had pressed this packet upon him and bade him wear it in his
bosom.
</p>

<p>Poor, disappointed creatures! What can the love of women avail against
the hate of men? Nothing.</p>

<p>Emeline pressed the moist hair flower into Drusilla's hand; but the
heart and hand, crimson-flecked now, she placed next her own heart. They

had been the sign of love in youth and rosy life; they should be
cherished
to remind her of the immortality which death can bring.</p>

<p>This was almost the end. Emeline's brave boy, Will Anderson, who had
given her his fidelity in childhood, had bestowed upon his country his
fidelity in manhood. To the oppressed of his countrymen he had extended
the
help of his strong <i>hand</i>; in their defense his <i>heart</i> had
been
pierced by a bullet. He and his son, Augustus, were buried at Nauvoo.</p>



<p>A time of anxious toil ensued; for even through the darkest tragedy runs
a thread of the commonplace. And in the midst of the anxious commotion
and
labor Emeline and Drusilla became separated. They never met again in this

life; and from that hour Drusilla's history is to this writer unknown.</p>



<p>Emeline Anderson lived to emigrate to Utah and to receive the blessings
of this fair land. She accepted through the remainder of this life the
name
of a worthy man, and she reared a third daughter. She carried with her
until the hour of her death the tear-stained, blood-stained <i>heart and

hand</i>; and when she was no more, these hallowed shreds of paper passed

into the possession of her children.</p>

<p>This is a life sketch. Those of the characters who have gone seem now
not to have been torn away by the rude hand of death, but to have faded
gently into the past, leaving their looks, their love, their loyalty for

their descendants.</p>

<p class="chapterHeading">DESCRIPTION OF THE ROUTE&mdash;OBJECT OF THE
JOURNEY&mdash;CONFRONTED BY INDIANS&mdash;DISCOVERY OF RUBIES&mdash;MORE

INDIANS VISIT CAMP&mdash;AN INSPIRED SUGGESTION&mdash;THE INDIANS BECOME

FRIENDLY.</p>

<p>On the 18th of September, 1854, I started for Carson Valley, by the
advice and consent of Brigham Young, and in the employ of Colonel E. J.
Steptoe of the U. S. army.</p>

<p>I went south of the Great Salt Lake and across the then unknown deserts
where now are many towns, villages and cities, the settlement of which
was
hastened some years by that trip of exploration.</p>

<p>The city of Genoa, immediately under the shadow of the Sierra Nevada
Mountains, consisting of about a dozen or fifteen houses, was the only
actual settlement between Grantsville and Hangtown, California, a
distance
of one thousand miles by the wagon road over the Goose Creek Mountains,
which are one hundred miles north of Salt Lake City; and to find a
shorter
road so as to save this one hundred miles and to avoid the mountains was

the object of my journey.</p>

<p>At the time of which I write this great mountain country of five hundred
miles in each direction from Salt Lake City, was an almost unknown
wilderness, a country inhabited only by Indians and wild game, excepting

the few settlements of this people; and the country was but little
explored, except so far as the wants of the people made it necessary.</p>



<p>Colonel Steptoe was sent by the United States government, with two
companies of the U. S. army, as a military governor to take the place of

Brigham Young. This was a very quiet, secret movement of our nation to
establish a new form of republican government over this people; but
thanks
to that overruling, inspirational power of God that has so often turned
the
hearts of men, and the good, honest sense of Col. Steptoe, who, when he
had
spent eight or nine months with this people, declined the dishonorable
and
unrepublican office of military governor of Utah. He said that no man but

Brigham Young could govern this people, "and if he stepped into Governor

Young's place, Brigham Young would still govern the people." He therefore

decided to leave for California as early in the Spring of 1855 as he
could,
and in order to find a new route through south of the Lake he sent an
exploring party through to Carson and back that Fall, late as it was.</p>



<p>He applied to Brigham Young for suitable persons for so arduous and
hazardous an undertaking. I was chosen as one and was furnished an
interpreter (my nephew, C. A. Huntington), and an Indian guide, a young
man
by the name of Natsab, a son of the Indian chief who was ruler in Salt
Lake
Valley when we first settled the country&mdash;these two were designed to

return with me. Besides these was Col. John Reese, now living in Salt
Lake
City, and he was an excellent companion. His home was in Carson Valley,
which at that time was a part of Utah Territory, and he had two men with

him, one Willis and a man by the name of Davis, who had been to
California,
made a raise, returned to the States and was now making his way west
again
with a very fleet race-horse in hope of opening another "stake" by
gambling.
</p>

<p>My outfit consisted of six animals to ride and pack, a quantity of goods
to use as presents in making peace with the savages we might pass on the

way, a good compass to guide us on cloudy days in the deserts and a good

quantity of provisions and bedding.</p>

<p>When we had got about two or three miles from Salt Lake City we found
eleven men, formerly of Col. Steptoe's outfit of teamsters,
camp-followers,
etc., who, knowing of our search for a short route to California,
determined to sail under the "Mormon" flag as far as Carson.</p>

<p>I had no objections, because their numbers would lend us an appearance
of strength among the native tribes. They were rather poorly mounted,
armed
and provisioned, which latter condition occasioned me eventually some
annoyance and suffering, compelling the whole company to live on
horseflesh
during two hundred and fifty miles of the journey; and during one day and

night we were without even that.</p>

<p>For some time nothing of importance occurred on our way, except that we
had one horse shot accidentally and one of our strangers lost a mule in a

night march across a mud desert.</p>

<p>On the 28th of September, as we were passing through a large valley of
meadow land with scattering bunches of tall wheat grass and stools of
greasewood, an Indian, naked except for a covering about his loins, with

gun in hand, stood before us suddenly and stopped our movements. After a

very short and unedifying oration he fired his gun in the air, and
instantly there arose an Indian from behind every bunch of grass and
greasewood all around us until there was quite an army in view, and we
saw
it was necessary to talk in persuasive tones and our orders were enforced

with many presents, in giving which the interpreter was very expert. The

Indians guided us to some very fine springs of water and small ponds not

far distant, where we distributed quantities of tobacco, pipes, paints,
calico, etc.</p>

<p>At this place we passed the night; but in the morning the Indians were
all gone, which to men acquainted with Indian natures, indicated hostile

intentions, and we therefore traveled cautiously to the west side of the

valley, where we nooned at a little creek which came down out of a great

range of mountains lying to the east of us, running north and south as
far
as we could see. Here Mr. Davis said was as good a prospect for gold as
any
place he had seen in California. We dug a little dirt and washed it out
and
found several rubies, one very large and fine. We therefore called the
place Ruby Valley.</p>

<p>We soon moved on south a few miles; but feeling forebodings of evil,
stopped about 2, p.m., on a fine, grassy place near a spring and sent Mr.

Davis ahead to reconnoitre the country, which was mostly clear and open
to
the end of the valley, about twelve miles distant. He rode cautiously
about
five miles when, on looking over his left shoulder, he saw an Indian on
foot running towards the road behind and dropping into the grass as Davis

looked around. He instantly wheeled his horse and sped for camp. Just as
he
started back an Indian on horseback started from some willows near by to

cut off his retreat, but that racehorse outran the Indian pony, although

the latter had the advantage.</p>

<p>When these facts were known in camp every man prepared for the worst. We
had chosen an open piece of ground where we could not be surprised in
daylight. We were preparing an early supper so as to have it over before

any surprise might be undertaken. Just as we were sitting down to eat,
seven Indians on horseback rode slowly towards our camp, came past our
horses which were grazing near and dismounted near our fires. We saluted

them kindly with "how-de-do," and they replied. They were all dressed in

coats, pants, overcoats, caps, etc, and rode well shod horses, excepting

one short, thick-set Indian, about twenty-three years old, who wore
buckskin pants, a hickory shirt, a Panama hat and with his hair cut short

and straight around his neck; he was very wide between the eyes, rode a
very large mare without a saddle. He came to my mess where I, my nephew
and
Natsab were just sitting down to eat, and shook hands.</p>

<p>We sat with guns and pistols in our laps. I told all our company to be
very careful, as this one could talk English. The interpreter tried to
talk
with him, but to no effect until he spoke in the Snake language, when he

answered some. They were observing our actions, habits, etc., and making

their calculations how and when to take our scalps. I felt that under the

Panama hat was a dreadful chief for blood and plunder, and that he could

talk English; and I was right in my judgment or feelings.</p>

<p>As soon as the interpreter and I were done eating, we walked around the
horses after cautioning the men. While driving the animals a little
nearer
camp he asked me if I had noticed a secret sign, a strange motion, the
Indian made as he shook hands with us, and he showed it to me, stating
that
he believed these Indians were of the tribe and party who had done so
many
murders on the Humboldt, among the California gold seekers, and that he
believed they were banded with whites by secret oaths, signs and
pass-words. Immediately after he told this I felt a strange but bright
sensation come over my mind and I could see with my heart, or my spirit
could see without my eyes. I told him we would leave the horses and go
quickly to camp, where he should go up to that Indian (the chief), give
him
the same sign he had given us, and that we would then be safe among
them.
</p>

<p>He did this and the effect was astonishing. The Indian shook hands and
hugged him heartily.</p>

<p>I gave further instructions to the interpreter what to say about a
certain man whom we knew lived on the Humboldt River, where so much
murdering had been done, and with whom I went to school in Nauvoo. Every

word had its effect as I anticipated, and the chief understood that this

man who lived on the Humboldt, and whom very many believed to be the
cause
of all the murdering done there for money and plunder, was our friend
from
boyhood; but the opposite might be said to be nearly true, as we held no

sympathy in common, although we had been boys together. The chief called

that man his "daddy," meaning father.</p>



<h2><a name="3chap2">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="chapterHeading">INDIANS' STRATAGEM TO GET ONE OF OUR HORSES&mdash;
PROCEED ON OUR WAY&mdash;HOW INSPIRATION IS RECEIVED&mdash;AN
ILLUSTRATIVE
INCIDENT.</p>

<p>We will now leave these few Indians and seventeen white men, all in
peaceful, friendly chat, and go back to the 15th of September, 1854&mdash;

three days before we left Salt Lake City.</p>

<p>On the corner of East Temple Street, just two blocks south of the Temple
site was a cottonwood log, on which two young men were sitting in earnest

conversation. One was about twenty-four years old, a very tall, muscular

man, not less than six feet, two inches in height, with black eyes, set
wide apart under a heavy forehead and over high cheek bones. The whole
countenance indicated a cruel and heartless disposition. The other young

man was just twenty years old, medium height, with a well formed body,
small, sharp, twinkling blue eyes, regular features and a rather large
head.
</p>

<p>They had been quarreling; and when they arose from the log it was agreed
that the one who <i>crossed the other's path should die!</i></p>

<p>The older man was to start for his lone log house on the Humboldt, about
sixty miles from Ruby Valley, in a week or two, by way of Goose Creek
Mountains; and the young man was to start just three days from that time

for Carson Valley, as Indian interpreter for a U. S. exploring company,
traveling west from Salt Lake City. When we told "Bloody Chief," for such

was the name of the chief who visited our camp, that we were special
friends to the bad young man we thought not of the terrible consequences

that might result from that deceitful stratagem to save our lives then.
We
told the Indians frankly that we were coming back in a little more than
one
moon, but did not tell them there would be but three of us.</p>

<p>On the morning of September 30th, the same seven Indians came into our
camp without a gun, pistol, bow or arrow. All were merry and jolly, and
traded everything they could, and ran foot-races. They wanted to run
horses, but ours had too long a journey before them to admit of racing.
The
main object and effort of the Indians was to get that race-horse, but
they
did not succeed. They escorted us about eight miles on our way and told
us
all they could of the country ahead in the direction we wanted to go.
They
showed us a great deal of gold and silver coin, jewelry and
pocket-knives,
which they doubtless obtained by killing people on the Humboldt.</p>

<p>We left the valley at the south end, passing over a low divide and
through a narrow, rocky canyon, full of scattering cedar trees, making as

nice a place for ambush as an Indian could ask for the massacre of
whites.
</p>

<p>Many incidents occurred worthy of note in a mere narrative; but as I
design to show the inspiration of the Lord in our preservation, I shall
only give so much of our journey as is necessary to bring you to the
circumstances in an easy and natural way. All of God's works are done in
a
natural way; and He applies a law in one instance which would not do in
another. The inspiration of God to different men and to the same man in
different ways is a matter upon which I desire to enlarge some little.
Sometimes an idea is received in the mind that is foreign to anything
that
ever existed there before. The person follows that idea, which is so new

and to him unusual, and develops a wonderful piece of machinery or a
principle in philosophy, manufacturing or something otherwise useful to
man. That idea came as other ideas, he will say; but I am of the opinion

that it is the inspiration of God that brings out of chaos the very
useful
inventions and discoveries&mdash;this is the simplest form of
inspiration.
</p>

<p>Another man is perhaps laboring, as usual, in the field and is suddenly
inclined in his feelings to go to his house. Perhaps he tries to smother

the feeling, but finally yields and reaches home just in time to
extinguish
a fire that would certainly have consumed his house if he had not gone
just
as he did.</p>

<p>The inspiration of the Holy Ghost which is given to all who obey the
gospel by baptism and the laying on of hands of the Elders, was promised
by
the Lord to every one that earnestly and sincerely repents of his sins
and
obeys the gospel, and "it shall guide him into all truth."</p>

<p>I will tell you, my young friends, how that Holy Ghost will guide you.
If, when you are made clean from sin by baptism, you do not willingly
enter
again into sin, pray often, keep the Sabbath day holy, always try as
earnestly as you can to be a peacemaker, help every institution of Zion,

cheerfully obey every call of the Lord through those who have the
authority
from God to call, and live lives of purity in every way, that Holy Ghost

will be in you all the time and influence you in all your thoughts, words

and actions, bring to your mind things forgotten when you need them, and

suggest to your mind principle and doctrine, when really necessary, that

has never been taught you in this life, but which you knew before you
came
to this world.</p>

<p>I will mention another incident of inspiration in my own experience,
different from the one already related concerning the secret sign among
the
Indians.</p>

<p>In 1867, I had a friend who was going to San Bernardino, California, and
was to start on the second day after the following conversation between
us:
</p>

<p>"Oliver, come and go to California with me."</p>

<p>"I cannot."</p>

<p>"Yes you can; you can go as well as not."</p>

<p>"I have nothing to leave for the support of my family during the
Winter;" (I having been sick for five or six months, and unable to earn
anything.)</p>

<p>"I'll lend you what money you want," said he.</p>

<p>"Well, I cannot go, and there is no use thinking or taking about it," I
finally replied.</p>

<p>That evening I was going home and thinking of my family affairs, but
nothing about going with my friend. A voice, sounding as though it was
about a foot from my left ear, whispered:</p>

<p>"Go with Hyrum to California."</p>

<p>The voice was as distinct as any I ever heard, and I half turned to see
if anyone was there, but saw no one; and after debating a short time in
my
mind decided that I must not refuse, and I said mentally, "Well, I
will."
</p>

<p>The next day I saw Hyrum and told him I would go with him and I wanted
fifty dollars to leave with my wife. He handed me the money and I started

with him on the following morning.</p>

<p>My health improved all the way there. I worked at carpenter work all
Winter and returned in the Spring, a sound, healthy man.</p>

<p>Other advantages and information gained while gone, prove to me that I
was inspired or told to go and do the very thing that was necessary for
my
present salvation. It was a very important mission to me; and how
important
no mortal but myself knows.</p>

<p class="chapterHeading">OUT OF PROVISIONS&mdash;LIVE ON HORSE FLESH&mdash;
ARRIVAL AT CARSON&mdash;START BACK FOR HOME&mdash;DESCRIPTION OF THE
JOURNEY
&mdash;AIDED BY RED MEN&mdash;MEET WITH MORE INDIANS&mdash;OUR MANNER OF

DEALING WITH THEM.</p>

<p>Three days after leaving our newly-made friends, the Indians, we were on
a hard desert, where in one place we crossed a field of crystallized
mineral
of some kind, which had the appearance of ice, and rode our horses safely

over it. That night, on the same desert, one of the fattest horses in the

company failed and was left just before we had crossed the desert, and it

was nearly morning when we camped. At daylight I sent for the horse to
eat,
as we were then out of provisions.</p>

<p>The uninvited increase of the company had very small rations at
starting, and when their food was exhausted I fed them until there was
nothing left to eat for any of us, then we killed the horse and lived on

its flesh for one week.</p>

<p>Two days after killing the horse we were on another desert and traveled
until far into the night, for we could see no end to the desert; and
since
living on horseflesh for food we crowded the animals to make the best
time
possible to get where better food could be had, and more water, for we
found water scarce and both men and beasts were in a suffering condition.

About 2 o'clock in the morning a stop was made to rest the animals, for
they had neither food nor water for over twenty-four hours. The saddles
were removed and the animals were turned loose in the desert, where
neither
bush, stick nor grass could be seen. Being loosened, the animals all
began
feeding on something, though we could see nothing. We set out a guard, as

usual. In the morning we found the horses feeding on a weed or grass of a

wine color, about four inches high, covering in area about eight acres,
and
nowhere else did we ever see any more of that kind of feed.</p>

<p>We reached Carson on the 15th of October. We could not start back until
word could be got to and from San Francisco. It was getting late in the
season and we soon began to feel uneasy about the Winter snows we might
encounter, but I had thought of this all the way and took such notes of
the
route as would enable me to recognize the way again even if the mountains

should be covered with snow. I kept what sailors would call a "log book,"

in which was written a regular description of every landscape&mdash;
certain
shaped mountains here, a grove of cedars there, etc.; and at every turn
of
the road, consulted the compass, noting the various directions, and had
some certain land-marks at each turn, with estimates of distances between

points.</p>

<p>While not otherwise engaged in Genoa, as it is now called, I made a map
of the road we had traveled, noting every watering-place, desert,
mountain,
grove of timber, plot of grass, etc., not forgetting to mark my distances

as well as the points of compass.</p>

<p>While at Genoa, Natsab, the Indian, left me one night and started home
on foot and alone and made his way in safety. It was a week before I
found
which way he had gone, and feared much that the Indians there had killed

him. I saw him after I arrived home and asked his reason for leaving me
without notice. He said he was afraid we would have to stay all Winter;
and
that if I had known he was going to leave I would stop him and make him
stay too, and that was too long to live among the whites; he would have
got
sick and perhaps died.</p>

<p>At last the word came from San Francisco, and a man also to go with us
to Salt Lake, which was very acceptable. Col. Reece resolved to fit up
two
men besides himself and accompany me one or two hundred miles, just to
explore the country; for of the route we were to take nothing was known
by
white men, and we were all enthusiastic to search the unexplored
regions.
</p>

<p>On November 2, 1854, I started for home, with five animals for my own
outfit of myself and the interpreter. Our through friend and partner for

the trip back, Mr. Kinsey, had two horses, thus making seven well-loaded

animals for three men to take care of. One large mule carried a keg of
water as a reserve for times of distress. We each carried a canteen of
water on our saddles as we rode; and several times our riding horses
would,
when our canteens were only partly full so that the water would sound as

the motion of their bodies shook them, turned and hunted for the water
and
whinnyed coaxingly for a little sup of the water they had carried so
long.
</p>

<p>Carson River, at which point Mr. Davis overtook us, sinks or empties
into a lake of its own, which is about twenty miles across. Around the
lake
is a very flat and large extent of country, wet and marshy, which affords

great quantities of a grass known as "bayonet grass;" this yields tufts
or
bunches of black, rich seed that the Indians manage to cut and dry and
then
thresh or pound out the seed for their Winter's bread. We saw many
large-sized stacks of the remains of their threshing at their
threshing-floors, which were mostly inaccessible to horses, being on
small,
dry places in the midst of the sodded marshes that yield the grass.</p>

<p>After passing around the south end of the lake we crossed a low divide
and entered a new valley some thirty miles from the lake. Where we
entered
this new desert valley was among rolling hills of sand blown up by the
wind, some perhaps twenty feet high and covering from a half to a full
acre
of ground. In passing among these hills and valleys I saw the heads of
two
Indians who had not yet seen us. I took in the whole situation at a
glance:
a large alkali desert was before us in which was no water, while that we

had in store was small and poor. Those Indians were not there without
water
being near, and if we could get them we could perhaps induce them to find

or show us water. Our horses in the sand made no noise traveling, so we
started at our best speed and soon overtook those whom we wanted as
guides.
They took us to water, though very reluctantly, and indeed not until they

understood that they must do so.</p>

<p>We would never have found the water of ourselves; for the spring was in
the top of a little elevation that covered perhaps five acres in the
center
of a valley. The spring was round and perhaps five feet across. It gave a

rapid supply of water, but had no visible outlet. The Indians had fenced
it
with tall greasewood brush stuck in the ground as thick as they could put

it, except at an opening about eight inches wide which would permit
rabbits
to enter, where they were trapped. A pit about two and one-half feet deep

was dug in this opening and a strong, wiry sand-grass was fastened on
either side of the hole so that the ends would overlap at the center of
the
hole or pit, making apparent smooth floor. When a rabbit jumped on it
went
down into the pit, which had no water in it. The grass readily sprang
back
to its place and was prepared for another rabbit. This continued until
the
pit was full, for it was so narrow and deep there was no chance to jump
out. Three similar pits, at a distance from the spring, was prepared for

antelope.</p>

<p>We camped here, used the greasewood for cooking supper and refreshed our
horses. We kept the Indians all night with us so they could not notify
others, who would perhaps prove dangerous. It was the intention to take
them a day on the journey, but they escaped when we were not watching
them.
We traveled, after getting a full supply of water, all that day, all
night
and until 2 o'clock in the afternoon of the next day without any rest,
except that got by stopping to eat and drink and tend the animals. This
long journey was necessary in order to find grass and water.</p>

<p>About half or three-quarters of a mile before coming to the water our
animals began to crowd ahead&mdash;pull on the bit&mdash;which surprised
us
all, as there were no signs of water, such as willows, trees or grass, in

sight to attract our attention, nothing but the smooth desert of small,
short desert brush, with occasional fields of sage brush. Suddenly our
animals stopped at a little, swift-running brook not more than two or
three
feet wide.</p>

<p>Here we rested, watered and prepared for our journey. Towards evening we
moved about two miles to some low sand hills, which generally afford an
excellent grass called sand-grass. The next day we spent in trying to get

more easterly over the mountains, but failed.</p>

<p>The second day after watering we would gladly have passed through the
range of mountains by a canyon; but thinking it impossible, had started
on
north again nearly a mile, when someone called behind us. On looking
around
we saw two Indians running towards us. We waited until they came up. They

then enquired where we were going, and on being told, said we would all
die
if we continued in that direction for it was three days' travel to water.

They led us to water in the mountains and stayed with us that night and
were well pleased with their newly-made friends, but not more so than we

were; for they seemed more like kind old friends, and in the parting got

their full share of presents.</p>

<p>On that camp ground I set the compass, but to my surprise one end of the
needle dropped down and remained thus. Move the needle where I would it
did
the same. We were on a mountain of iron and probably some magnetic ore
was
near.</p>

<p>The next day was the 12th of November, 1854, and by favor of one of
these good red men we got through the mountains to a fine, large spring
creek, and there camped. Now, who can deny the hand of the Lord and His
power in sending these natives with softened hearts to call us from
certain
death and kindly bring us through to these beautiful springs? None of us

did; even the Gentiles with us acknowledged His hand in that act of the
savage Indian.</p>

<p>The next morning, Col. Reece, with his two men, left us and turned south
to explore three or four days in that direction and then turn westward on

their course home. During this journey he made the very important
discovery
of the Reece River and country now so profitable to the State of Nevada.
</p>

<p>We continued our course east one day and a half, and then struck the
southern extremity of our outward route, which was a very plain trail at

that place and was just at the foot of a long slope approaching a high,
rocky, rugged mountain, over which we had to pass.</p>

<p>Indians and snow-storms were alike a dread to us to encounter; and the
former were now before us when within about half a mile of the mouth of a

very narrow, rocky canyon. They had the advantage of us, for they were
nearest the rocks that overhung the road and were on the run in a half
bent
posture when first seen on the side of the mountain, but they
straightened
and sprang to the race right manfully when once in sight, until they were

safe among the rocks, where they took positions of safety, only exposing

their heads.</p>

<p>We approached slowly, all the while consulting as to what was the best
policy to pursue. We did not want to go around the mountain to the south,

for of the distance we knew nothing, and to fight we were afraid; for
numbers and position were against us, there being only four of us and
seven
we could see of them. Speaking of four of us reminds me that when eighty

miles from Genoa, a man by the name of Davis came to us from California,

having heard of the exploring party going to Salt Lake. He had a very
large
herd of sheep <i>en route</i> for California, which was obliged to Winter

in Utah, and being anxious to join it he was willing to take chances with

us.</p>

<p>The most feasible plan now was to make friends of them with presents.
This being decided upon we concluded to try it, and if it failed we must

try to force a passage. We consoled ourselves with the saying, "a coward

cornered is the worst man in the world to fight." By some means, however,

we expected, by the help of the Lord, to get through.</p>

<p>After talking and preaching to the natives half an hour or more the
interpreter allured them down near us&mdash;so near that presents, small

articles we had on our persons, were given them by one of us while the
other three guarded against any treacherous surprise. They were then told

to go with us to the top of the mountain, where we would camp for the
night
and we would there give them more valuable articles which were on the
horse. They finally consented and told us to go on ahead; but feeling
safer
with their backs to us than ours to them we succeeded in having them take

the lead. They were strong, fierce, desperate-looking men, and we did not

care to give them any advantage over us, so we kept our eyes on them and

our hands on our guns, even after we had camped at a nice spring in a
large
opening in the top of the mountain.</p>

<p>Our greatest safety against these and other Indians that might be
lurking around, was to take their bows and arrows into our possession,
which we did very quietly after giving the promised gifts. They looked
rather sorry at seeing themselves entirely in our power.</p>

<p>For our future safety I thought it best to teach our neighbors a lesson
in gun tactics, for we felt sure their knowledge of guns was limited to
hearsay, they were so very wild and unacquainted with white men. My plan

was as follows: I went into a narrow ravine well out of sight, cut a
couple
of leaves out of my memorandum book, doubled them, shot a hole through
the
center and then cut them in two. One of these I secretly gave to Mr.
Kinsey. The interpreter and I then got into high words. The Indians
wanted
to know what we were talking about. He told them that I thought I could
beat him shooting. They manifested much interest in the matter. I took a

leaf from my book, folded and cut it exactly like the first and put it in

the split of a stick about three feet long, gave this to Mr. Kinsey, all
in
plain view of the natives, and he put it up about one third of a mile
off,
but exchanged papers on the way and substituted the one with a hole in
the
center.</p>

<p>The interpreter shot with a dragoon revolver and sent an Indian for the
mark. He came back on the run and talking as hard as he could. The
Indians
all joined in the talk but superstitiously avoided touching the paper.</p>



<p>I could not, of course, shoot better than that and therefore did not
try; besides, it was getting dark.</p>

<p>The following morning, which was the 17th of November, one of the
natives volunteered to go with us, saying that he "lived over that way."
He
ran on foot by the side of our horses all day and we rode most of the
time
on the gallop.</p>

<p>That night, about 1 o'clock, the Indian ran away from the guard&mdash;
one man with gun in hand&mdash;and got clear with his life and two
blankets
that were not his.</p>

<p>In the morning we found his tracks in the trail ahead of us and we were
satisfied that evil was designed against us. We were but a
day-and-a-half's
ride from the south end of Ruby Valley, and two and one-half days' ride
from the north end, where most of the Indians were.</p>

<p>That day, at noon, we came to water on a high ridge, from which I could
see a canyon pass through the mountains at the north end of Ruby Valley,

which lay north by north-east from us, and the south end nearly east,
leaving a great angle or elbow for us to make, which was an object to
save.
From one place only on this high ridge could be seen this low place in
the
distant mountains; and as soon as my eyes rested on it the idea was given

me that we could get through that pass and save a great distance, and
what
else it might save I did not know, unless it was our hair. I at once
informed the men of the gap in the mountains and my idea that it was best

to travel that way; they agreed with me. We turned our horses that way
and
every one of us felt right sure then that in the plan was our safety.</p>



<p>We traveled that afternoon and until perhaps 12 o'clock in the night and
camped on a creek at the foot of the gap, probably ten miles from the
top,
where we made neither light nor noise.</p>



<h2><a name="3chap4">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="chapterHeading">PREMONITIONS OF DANGER&mdash;LEARN OF AN ATTEMPT
TO KILL US&mdash;AN INDIAN'S ADVICE&mdash;UNDECIDED ABOUT WHAT COURSE TO

TAKE&mdash;APPEAL TO THE LORD&mdash;PRAYER ANSWERED&mdash;REACH HOME IN
SAFETY.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of the 19th we were in motion, fearing that that
day might bring the greatest trial of our lives. Right on the divide we
met
about fifteen old men, women and children, but none that could draw the
bow
in battle were there. The interpreter, who was well versed in Indian
policies and tactics, said:</p>

<p>"There, boys, that tells the story&mdash;not a warrior here and these
are sent off out of danger."</p>

<p>We came out into the valley about 2 o'clock very still, slow and
cautious, but saw no signs of life near. We had to ride hard so that, if

possible, we might get across the valley unobserved. We succeeded, and
just
as the sun was setting we reached a little basin or valley among low
hills
on our old trail, where there was a fine spring of water. We looked
carefully all over the country behind us as we left the valley, but saw
no
signs of life except many smokes.</p>

<p>Our hearts nearly came to a standstill as we turned the ridge down into
the little basin, at the sight of seven Indians on the run for the water.

We had to have the right of water even if necessary to fight for it; and
we
started on the run. The ground was so open that we could see no point of

advantage the Indians could gain by getting to water first, so we rode
more
leisurely and we came together at the spring.</p>

<p>As they appeared in every motion to be friendly, we dismounted, threw
off our saddles and packs as though we were at home, never forgetting to

keep our eyes open and revolvers handy. The first thing to test their
friendship was to smoke&mdash;if they would smoke with us they would
talk,
and if they would talk we could be friends and learn something.</p>

<p>When the oldest man had smoked, he asked in astonishment how we got
there.</p>

<p>The interpreter said: "We rode here on our horses."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the old man, "I saw you do that; but what road did you come?"
</p>

<p>He was told, and replied:</p>

<p>"That is the only way you could come."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>Then he went on to tell us that the Indian, Natsab, who ran away in
Carson, had passed there telling when he thought we would be along. The
Bloody Chief we saw in the valley going out came all through the valley,

calling the men to the rocky canyon that leads out of the valley and
there
they thought to kill us all and divide the spoils, expecting the whole
seventeen men to return.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you go?" was asked.</p>

<p>The old man fumbled among his rags and pulled out a piece of tobacco
about one and one-half inches square and said, "I showed him that tobacco

and told him you gave me it, and I could not fight you as long as that
lasted."</p>

<p>"What it that had all been gone?" was asked.</p>

<p>The old man had as mild and pleasant eyes as I ever saw in an Indian's
head, and he raised them with as much honesty and simplicity as a child,

after looking in the fire a minute, and said:</p>

<p>"I don't know what I would have done."</p>

<p>His heart seemed to correspond with his eye.</p>

<p>The six men with him were his sons and sons-in-law. He kept them from
going to fight us. His camp was about a mile from the spring. After
talking
awhile we tried the "long shot" game on them and found the paper shot
through the center as before. We wanted to impress all Indians with the
belief that when they fought us, the farther off they could get the safer

they would be.</p>

<p>Then we smoked again and all had lunch. The Indians got lots of gifts,
the whites none. Then came the good old man's last advice and council:</p>



<p>"I do not know whether they will get track of you before morning or not;
but they <i>will</i> get on your track," said the mild-eyed man. "You
must
not let the sun see you here. To-morrow when the sun looks down from
behind
the top of that mountain you must be a long way from here. Ride hard all

day; and when night comes, don't stop riding, but ride hard all night,
and
in the morning you will be in the Goshute land and they will not follow
you
there. They have long been wanting your meat, and when they find only
your
tracks they will ride like the wind."</p>

<p>When he had done talking, they all arose with a mild dignity, wrapped
their remnants of blankets around them, turned their faces towards their

home among the cedars and none looked around, except the mild-eyed man,
who
gave us a look of mingled pity and hope, then nodded his head towards
their
home, gave a motion of the hand and a prolonged sigh, as much as to say,

"I'm going home to sleep."</p>

<p>The old man's advice to us was carefully followed. I examined my journal
and notes of the country before we started. The whole day's travel was
over
a level country from one valley to another, with no high divide or hardly
a
separating hill; but at noon I found myself lost, in spite of all my care

and even extra caution preparatory for such an important day. I could not

find any lack of attention in myself and no responsibility was upon any
other person in the matter&mdash;the route was very plain, and yet I had

gone to the left of a mountain instead of to the right. I knew where we
were, although there was no trail on either route, yet I knew we had
taken
the wrong side of the mountain. I was afraid of the result and questioned

whether it would give our pursuers any advantage. Should we turn back or
go
ahead? was another question.</p>

<p>Our lives was the game we were playing for that day, and the
responsibility of correct moves was upon me. The thought made me sweat
like
rain. I told all the men and asked them to ride slowly, very slowly,
while
I rode up the mountain to see if I could make any discovery. I rode to a

good, secure place and there knelt upon the ground and, with my whole
soul,
asked God to show me what to do in this trying time of uncertainty.</p>

<p>I arose and mounted my horse, fully satisfied. I knew how it would
terminate. An impression a feeling, some would call it, made me
understand
this: "Go on; you will come out all right;" that is, keep going as you
are
going, and you will come around to the right place, was what it meant.</p>



<p>Some might ask, How did you get that information? I can only tell you
that it was spoken in those words to my soul. It was planted instantly in

my understanding by the power of God. It was revealed to my spirit
independent of the body.</p>

<p>I rode down and overtook my fellow-travelers in perfect cheer and told
them that we would go on, we were going just right.</p>

<p>Just before sunset we came to the very water I had intended, in the
morning, to reach, which was in a nice, grassy vale close by a large
cedar
grove, and on looking back on the route I designed to come, we saw, on a

point of the mountain, three smokes near to each other, which among
Indians
means to rally to some appointed place. We all, Gentiles though two of
the
company were, acknowledged the hand of God in guiding us, as we thought,

the wrong way.</p>

<p>Water, grass and rest our animals must have in order to carry us safely
through the night. We could see the Indian smokes; they could see ours
and
very likely see us. We must make them think we were going to stay all
night, so we drove the horses away from camp quite a distance and towards

the Indians, gathered a good lot of wood, ate supper and waited
impatiently
for the mantle of night to be thrown over our movements.</p>

<p>As soon as I felt sure the Indians' keen eyes could not see our moves
through the darkness, two men ran for the horses and drove them around so

the fire would not show their forms. The other two men carried the
saddles
far back from the fire, where we hastily saddled and left the horses in
care of one man while the other three went to the fire, put on all the
wood
and lazily passed and re-passed between the distant Indians and the fire,

then mounted and rode with good speed from our comfortable fire and
beautiful Antelope Spring. This place received its name, Antelope Spring,

as follows: On approaching this place, as we went west, we saw a drove of

antelope feeding just in the edge of the scattering cedars, and one
antelope quite a little behind the rest, which one of our men prepared to

shoot; but all the animals seeing us ran away. The one behind was thrown

into a dreadful fright, and could not run with the others, while the man

prepared to shoot. He resolved to be an antelope no longer, and with
magical power threw off his antelope skin, and in the twinkling of an
eye,
stood up a tall Indian with bow and arrows in hand. He followed us to
camp
and there showed us all about the transformation.</p>

<p>We rode all night as fast as we could and at dawn came into a little
gulch, where water was found. Here we turned our animals loose and all
but
two of us laid down and slept until sunrise. That morning was beautiful
to
us. We now felt ourselves out of danger and quietly pursues our journey
homeward, without any other important event occurring. We reached home on

the 25th of November, 1854.</p>

<p>This was an important event to us and our families and friends. One
thing that made it more important to my wife and relatives was a report
from a man who undertook to overtake us a day or two after we left Salt
Lake City for Carson. He was a relic of the army, and failing to overtake

us as soon as he expected, became faint-hearted from the forbidding and
uninviting surroundings of a lone man among Indians and deserts, and
turned
back. He arrived safely in Salt Lake City and undoubtedly thought himself

very fortunate in so doing; and to excuse himself beyond the possibility

of reproach among his associates, he made up an inexcusable falsehood and

told that he came to the place where the Indians had massacred every one
of
our party. The deed had just been done and the bodies lay mangled and
stripped of clothing. He was obliged to make a hasty retreat to avoid
being
discovered and served the same.</p>

<p>On arriving in Salt Lake I delivered all U. S. property in my possession
to Colonel Steptoe and as soon as possible made my official report in
writing and got my release. In my report was given an outline of the
road,
which, however, he did not think practicable for his army in the
following
Spring. From my journal of the trip and the map, I formed what was called

in those days a guide book, which was a minute account of the road, by
which a stranger to the country could safely travel it without danger of

being lost.</p>

<p>Our Delegate to Congress then was acquainted with this book, and as he
was about to start for Washington by way of San Francisco, he offered to

take the guide book and if he could sell it to Congress he would give me

half the proceeds. In San Francisco he was offered $1000 for it, but
would
not let it go for that amount. I think he did not sell it, for I never
received any money for it.

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
